<p>'The Past that is not overpast,</p>
<p class="i2">But present here.'</p>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a dusty, time-soiled packet of legal papers which had lain
untouched for nigh upon two hundred years, the extraordinary
history of Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz is set forth in all the
colourless reticence of official documents. And yet something
of the thrill of the superstitious fear, and the virtuous disapproval
of the lawyers who composed these writings, pierces
through the stilted phrases. Like a faint fragrance of faded
rose-leaves, a breath of this woman's charm seems to cling
and elusively to peep out of the curt record of her crimes.
Enough at least to incite the wanderer in History's byways
to a further study of this potent German forerunner of the
Pompadour.</p>

<p>To search through the Stuttgart archives, to ferret out
forgotten books in dusty old book-shops, to fit together the
links in the chain of events of the woman's story, to haunt
the scenes of bygone splendour in deserted palace and castle,
old-world garden and desolate mansion; such has been the
delightful labour which has gone to the telling of the true
history of the Gr&auml;venitz. The Land-despoiler the downtrodden
peasantry and indignant burghers named her, for they hated
her as their sort must ever hate the beautiful, elegant, haughty
woman of the great world. They called her sinner, which she
was; and she called them canaille, which they probably were.</p>

<p>And traces of all this linger in W&uuml;rttemberg.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They still
deem the Countess Gr&auml;venitz a subject to be mentioned with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a>[<a href="./images/viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
bated breath&mdash;a thing too evil, too terrible, for polite conversation.
The very guides at Ludwigsburg slur over her name,
and if they go so far as to mention her, they say: 'Ja, das war
aber eine schlimme Dame,' and turn the talk to something else.
But her memory lives magnificently in the great palace built
for her, in her little 'Ch&acirc;teau Joyeux' of La Favorite, and in
the many beautiful properties which belonged to this extravagant
Land-despoiler. She came to W&uuml;rttemberg when the
country was at a low financial ebb. Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> had preyed
upon the land for years. Robber raids they called these wars
which he waged for trumped-up pretexts. After these invasions
came the war of the Spanish succession, and W&uuml;rttemberg
lying on the high-road from France to Austria, the belligerent
armies swept over the Swabian land on their way to battle.
The Duke of W&uuml;rttemberg, loyal to his Suzerain the Emperor
at Vienna, joined in the fray and fought bravely at the side
of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy against the French
terror. When Blenheim had been fought and won, the war-tide
swept northwards to the Netherlands, leaving Southern
Germany for the nonce at rest, and Eberhard Ludwig of
W&uuml;rttemberg repaired to Stuttgart to attend to his Duchy's
government. Now began the love-story of his life, the
long-drawn episode which made his name a target for the
gossip and scandal of early eighteenth-century Germany; the
episode which changed the simple, stiff family life of the
W&uuml;rttemberg ducal circle to a brilliant, festive court, which
travellers tell us in their memoirs vied in magnificence with
the glories of Versailles itself.</p>

<h3>THE INTRIGUE</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Es ist eine Hofkabale.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Schiller</span>.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the outskirts of the village of Oberhausen in South
Wirtemberg stands a deserted house. Rats are its only
denizens now; rats and the 'poor ghosts,' so the peasants say.
Two hundred years ago this eerie mansion was occupied by
living men and women, perchance the ghosts of to-day. Who
can tell? But I, who have grown to love them, having studied
the depths of their hearts, I pray that they may rest them
well in their graves, and that the Neuhaus ghosts be not my
friends of 1705.</p>

<p>It was a fitting place for intrigues this Neuhaus, standing as
it did so near in actual mileage to the court of Stuttgart, and
hard by the Jesuit centre of Rottenburg. The high-road was
close at hand, yet Neuhaus, shut off by peaceful fields, was
hidden from the passer-by, and here began the great intrigue,
as it was called then. Of a truth the plot, as it was conceived,
was no mighty thing; it was designed, as many another gossamer
web of court gallantry and petty pecuniary gain, for obscure
individuals; but great it became through the potent will of
a woman.</p>

<p>On a dreary November afternoon of the year 1705, a party
of four was assembled in the Neuhaus, the seldom-used
country mansion of Madame de Ruth, an important personage
at Stuttgart's court, and of Monsieur de Ruth, an undistinguished
character, who played no r&ocirc;le that we know of, save
to bequeath his ancient name&mdash;and the Neuhaus&mdash;to his relict.</p>

<p>The house was a long, two-storied building, with large,
black wooden beams showing quaintly outside against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>
white plastered walls; it was no imposing structure, but a
certain air of melancholy aloofness lent it distinction.</p>

<p>A high wall shut off the village street on the one side,
while to the south and east the mansion was surrounded by
a garden. A row of beech-trees grew close to the windows,
a narrow pathway led from a side door across the garden to a
vast orchard. It was doubtless a beautiful spot in spring or
summer, but on this November afternoon it was inexpressibly
dreary. The rain had beaten down the unkempt grass, which
lay in draggled sheaves along the edges of the pathway.
Brown, fallen beech leaves made a sodden carpet around the
tree-roots; the trees themselves, bare and gaunt, lifted their
grey, leafless branches towards the hurrying, wind-driven
clouds. The wind moaned fitfully round the house; every
now and then, as though in uncontrollable wrath, it broke
forth into a whistling howl. At intervals bursts of rain were
borne by the tempest against the windows, adding a hurried
patter to the tapping of the long beech branches, which grew
near enough to enable the wind to drive them against the
window-panes, while the greater branches strained and creaked
in the blast. Rain-laden clouds swept across the sky, hastening
the darkness of approaching night. It seemed strange
that on so desolate a gloaming the inmates of the Neuhaus
had not drawn the curtains to shut out the sadness of the
storm-ravaged garden. The windows remained like despairing,
unblinking eyes gazing at the desolate scene without.
The room wherein was assembled the small company was
unlit, save from the glow from the embers in the stove. The
upper grating had been opened, and in the furnace a handful
of half-dry wood sputtered and crackled, rising sometimes to
a momentary flame, in whose glow four persons threw strangely
contorted shadows on the ceiling. But for this, and a faint,
uncertain light which crept through the windows, the room
was entirely dark. When the wood flared, a lady seated to
the left of the stove cast a caricature-like shadow slantwise on
the ceiling, her head seeming gigantic in its piled-up masses
of elaborately dressed hair. In the middle of the room was a
huddled figure bending over the centre table. It seemed to
be a mere heap of dark garments. The firelight caught and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>
illumined a white ruffle and large pale hand belonging to this
figure, but as it was flung out across the sombre covering of
the table, the arm was invisible, and only the hand in the
ruffled sleeve could be seen, and it seemed like some hideous
dismembered thing. Outlined against the fading light stood
a tall figure with an enormous ringleted wig falling far over
the shoulders. When this being moved, his shadow, thrown
upon the ceiling by the embers' glow, appeared to join in the
wavering, dance-like movements of the other shadows, and
seemed like some ungainly monster. One portion of the
room was not reached either by light of fire or fading day,
and out of this utter darkness came the sound of repressed
sobbing, which alone revealed the presence of a fourth member
of this lugubrious party. For many minutes the silence was
unbroken save for the stealthy sobbing, the sough of the wind
without, the pattering rain, and the tap-tap of the twigs on
the windows, sounding for all the world like the fumbling of
invisible fingers seeking for admittance. The man at the
centre table broke silence at length.</p>

<p>'Impossible!' he said in a harsh voice. 'Madame la Baronne
cannot imagine we can live in Stuttgart at the court,' this last
pompously, in spite of the real distress of the voice. 'How can
we? on five hundred gulden a year and debts to pay&mdash;alas!
No! I must return to the army, only coming on leave once
a year to fulfil my court appointment; and, Marie, you must
live in Rottenburg with your mother while I am away.'</p>

<p>At this a figure moved out of the darkness behind the
stove, and another fantastic shadow was cast upon the ceiling.</p>

<p>'Never, Friedrich! It is cruel to ask it. You know well
enough that, if you did not gamble, we could live quite finely
on what we have got. Your duties as Kammerjunker need
not keep you for ever in Stuttgart; we might live in Rottenburg.'
She clasped her hands, her voice trembled between
tears and anger.</p>

<p>'Rottenburg&mdash;&mdash;' The man's voice was full of scorn,
vibrating with derision. 'Ah! yes!&mdash;Mass each morning,
and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Friedrich, I will never let you return to the army; rather
would I humble myself before that wicked woman, Madame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>
de Geyling, and beg her to influence Serenissimus to give you
a higher and better paid appointment. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Madame,' broke in a deep voice, and the figure at the
window moved forward, 'there are other ways of gaining gold at
court; a beautiful woman need never be poor, I can vouch&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Monsieur de Stafforth!' almost shouted the first speaker,
'you address my wife! I am poor, but the honour of a wife
of a Gr&auml;venitz shall not be smirched.'</p>

<p>'Your pardon, Kammerjunker, but we were discussing
necessities, not ideals, and surely I proposed a great honour.
Serenissimus is charming; besides, there are others&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The hostess, whose shadow we have seen on the ceiling,
rose and joined the three disputants.</p>

<p>'My friends, only fools end their conclaves with quarrels.
We have been discussing ways and means for the continuance
of our friends Monsieur and Madame de Gr&auml;venitz's court
life, and finding no practical scheme, here is Gr&auml;venitz crying
out that he will return to the army. Marie Gr&auml;venitz, after
sobbing her heart out, flies into a rage and declares she will
go whining to that upstart Geyling! And you, Monsieur
de Stafforth, Hofmarshall and successful courtier, propose
terms to a young husband in so unpolished a fashion, that
even a peasant would be obliged to retort with the old
affectation of a wife's honour and purity. Now hear me; I
know the court better than you do&mdash;&mdash;' The darkness hid the
meaning smiles which played over the lips of the others, for
Frau von Ruth (Madame de Ruth as she was named at court,
German being considered as a language only fitting for
peasants' use) was well known to have a knowledge of court
life not compatible with strictly decorous behaviour. 'Well!
and I say to you, where there is a court there is always a
way. And if you will so far honour me as to drink a bowl
of punch to lighten our wits, we may find some solution of
our friends' difficulties. First let me call for lights, and let me
shut out this dreary evening. Courage, my friends! I warrant
we shall smile some day at our present desperate straits,
and meanwhile "to wait" is the verb we must conjugate.'</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth went to the door and called for light.
A sullen-faced peasant boy appeared, carrying two silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>
candlesticks of a handsome old German design. He placed
them on the middle table, and the feeble yellow flame of the
waxen tapers shed a flicker into the long, gloomy room. Then
he stood idly staring, with the heavy dull-wittedness of the
Swabian peasant. Madame de Ruth eyed him for a moment,
with that half-humorous, half-pitying glance which she was
wont to bestow on those she found stupid. She was an odd-tempered,
free-mannered woman, deeply crafty, absolutely
unmoral, and yet with a true kindliness of heart and a
thorough understanding of human nature which, together with
her ready laugh, her clever, indecorous anecdotes and sharp
wit, made her attractive. For these traits people forgave her
her ugly face and fifty years of a past even less reputable
than was usual in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In her early youth, it was whispered, the Duke Wilhelm
Ludwig, father of the reigning Duke of Wirtemberg, had
initiated her into the ways of the world in general and of
courts in particular; in gratitude wherefore she was reputed
to have performed the same office, twenty years later, for his
son Eberhard Ludwig. The Duke of Zollern, several Hohenlohes,
and many Gemmingens had been her slaves; not to
mention other less illustrious cavaliers to whom she had been
rather more than kind. She was now a useful friend to
princes, and new arrivals at court found her friendship indispensable,
especially if the new arrival happened to be a
lady with aspirations to royal favour and a career. Up to
date these careers had been brilliant but short, and Madame
de Ruth had generally played an important part in each.</p>

<p>'Ah! Dieu! ces paysans, quelles brutes!' she said, as she
looked at her servant; and then speaking in the rough Wirtemberg
dialect she continued: 'Heinrich, thy mother gave thee
hands; God knows thy father did not forget thy big feet. Use
both and bring the punch, as I told thee; or I will give thee
hay for thy evening meal, as were fitting for an ass's feed!'
This somewhat drastic speech seemed to please the lad and to
stir up his slow wits, but the company looked surprised at the
familiarity of the 'thou,' it being the general custom in those
days for superiors to address their inferiors in the third person
singular. Directly to address a serving-man or maid was deemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>
incorrect, for it would have betokened an unfitting equality.
However, Madame de Ruth's peasant lad responded with
alacrity to his lady's homely speech, and in an astonishingly
short time he reappeared with an enormous bowl of the steaming
hot spirits&mdash;the punch, which Marlborough's army had
brought into fashion on the Continent, and which the damp of
South Germany in the autumn made a welcome beverage.</p>

<p>'Come, my friends, and drink to the sharpening of our wits,
which are strangely dull this evening. I must announce to
you that I await the visit to-night of the Duke of Zollern, but
this cruel weather has proved, I fear, too much even for his
youthful sixty years.'</p>

<p>'Madame,' said Monsieur de Stafforth, 'if the Duke of
Zollern does not brave the elements, in order to visit you, he
must indeed be feeling his sixty years.'</p>

<p>'Stafforth, do not natter me in that tone. I adore flattery,
but a stupid compliment is worse than an insult. You know
the Duke of Zollern and myself have long ceased incommoding
ourselves for each other's sakes, with the consequence that
we are really friends. He sees me when he wishes, and I see
him when I feel inclined. After twenty years <i>nous avons fini
nos simagr&eacute;es</i>; but after all, listen, I think I hear wheels.'
Her ugly old face flushed through the overlying paint and
powder. In spite of her protest, Madame de Ruth had a
remnant of her youth&mdash;a poor, faded flower of sentiment for
this old man. A huge lumbering coach drew up at the door,
and therefrom descended a small and shrunken figure, with a
wrinkled, dried-up face. A voluminous peruke fell over the
padded shoulders, rich lace ruffles adorned the sleeves of the
brown satin longcoat, a waistcoat of heavily embroidered
brocade reached far down, nearly to the shrunken knees,
below which were a pair of calves thin as pipe-stems and
adorned with brown silken hose; the shoes were of brown
leather with high, red heels and enormous ribbon rosettes and
diamond buckles. One withered hand held a cane with a
china top, on which, could you have examined it, you would
have found mythological subjects depicted with much delicacy
of workmanship, but less delicacy of sentiment. A beau indeed,
elegant, lavish, and with that air for the which Monsieur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>
de Stafforth, adventurer and burgher by birth, would have
given many a year of his successful climbing career to have
possessed even a shade,&mdash;the indescribable and inimitable air
of the Grand Seigneur.</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth met this gentleman at the door of her
abode, her peasant servant standing behind her, holding a
flaring torch to light the entry of his Grace. She curtseyed
deeply, and Monsieur de Zollern, having successfully hobbled
from his coach, returned her salute with so tremendous a bow,
that the long feather of his three-cornered hat swept the floor.</p>

<p>'I had almost given up the expectation of your visit, Monseigneur,'
said the lady, 'but now you are here, the pleasure is
all the greater'; and as he bowed once more over her hand, she
whispered: 'Pleasure you always gave me, dear friend.'</p>

<p>'Madame ch&egrave;re amie, those times are past, alas! Enfin!
we can still laugh together.'</p>

<p>They passed on through the gloomy corridor, and Madame
de Ruth herself threw open the door of the salon, crying as
she did so: 'The Duke of Zollern and Punch together must
make even a dark day bright!'</p>

<p>'Madame, in these days the last title might describe me
perfectly,' he said. Then as he saw the inquiring look on the
faces around him, he added: 'Autrefois j'&eacute;tais polichon, aujourd'hui,
h&eacute;las! ne suis-je qu'un vieux Polichinelle&mdash;"Punch"
they call it in England.'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, Punch must be a pretty wit indeed if he
be like your Grace,' said Stafforth, with his usual desire to
ingratiate himself with the great of the earth; but Monsieur
de Zollern did not deign to answer. Like Madame de Ruth
he preferred less directly expressed adulation. 'The fine
flavour of flattery is delicious,' he was wont to aver, 'but like
all else in life, to practise it requires an expert or a genius.
Open compliments on any subject are like sausages, to be
appreciated by peasants and our greasy friends the burghers,
but for us&mdash;we cannot digest them!' So he looked away
from Stafforth, giving his attention to the Gr&auml;venitz couple.
'Madame de Gr&auml;venitz,' he said, 'I observed you at Mass in
the Cathedral of Rottenburg a few days since. God forgives
the inattention at Mass of an old man when he sleeps; of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
a young man when he loves; and the wandering attention
of an <i>old</i> man blessed with a <i>young</i> heart the Almighty will
surely pardon, for He Himself must admire beauty, since He
made it.' Madame de Gr&auml;venitz looked perturbed. She was a
good and conscientious Catholic, and this light way of speaking
of things sacred seemed alarmingly daring to her; also, being
rather stupid, it bewildered her, and she had no answer for the
old courtier.</p>

<p>'Ah, Monsieur de Gr&auml;venitz,' continued Zollern, 'what
news from Mecklemburg? Does not your heart smite you
when you think of the country which gave you birth?'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, it was the only gift Mecklemburg ever gave
me, and indeed, to-night I am hardly grateful for the gift.
What is the use of life when it is so fierce a struggle not to
die of hunger?' he said, and drained his glass of punch. 'I
have such simple tastes.&mdash;Madame de Ruth, may I drink
another glass of your excellent punch?&mdash;I have such simple
tastes, and even these I cannot satisfy!'</p>

<p>The Duke of Zollern watched him, and his fine smile was
more of a commentary than many a spoken word. Gr&auml;venitz
observing it broke into a laugh, which was echoed by the
company.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' said Madame de Ruth, 'we have been sitting
here in the dark for two hours discussing Gr&auml;venitz's future.
I mean, of course, his fortune; we always say future when we
mean fortune! He vows that if more gulden cannot be lured
into his pocket, he must retire from court. We can find
no way out of our friend's dilemma. Can you suggest some
course?'</p>

<p>'Madame, to serve a friend of yours I am always ready!
Surely Serenissimus will not willingly lose a courtier he has
delighted in; but at this moment, I believe, Monsieur de
Stafforth will bear me out when I say all the court charges
are engaged; and Monsieur de Gr&auml;venitz, not being of the
sex, cannot hold the most important charge of any court, for
Madame de Geyling usurps that! So what can I suggest?'</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth was thoughtful for a moment; then, throwing
up her hands, she exclaimed: 'And you call me a woman
with wits? For two long hours have we deliberated and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>
found nothing, and it needed the punch-bowl to give me
an idea! We want three things, nay, four: to help Gr&auml;venitz
with funds; to dethrone that Geyling, whose airs and graces
have become intolerable; Monsieur de Stafforth seeks a
friend in the Duke's intimate, most intimate, council; and
our Mother Church desires a friend there too.' She ticked
off each succeeding clause on her much-beringed fingers.</p>

<p>'Monsieur de Gr&auml;venitz, you once told me you had a pretty
sister wasting her charms at G&uuml;strow. Let us put her in
the Geyling's place! A few years of that envied position
and we achieve our first two objects! Stafforth, my friend,
you are the man to find means of gaining your aims thereby
as well.' The adventurer smiled fatuously. 'And the Church&mdash;ah,
we forget the Church!' At these words the mocking
smile faded from Zollern's face; his expression was that of
a man whose interest was stirred, as indeed it was; for though
to Monseigneur de Zollern there was nothing sacred, and he
subjected all things to his biting wit, he gave conscientious
allegiance to the Church of Rome, which he regarded as the
only faith fitted for a gentleman. He belonged to the political
party desirous of governing Wirtemberg in conjunction with
the Jesuits. No matter that the people were strict and bigoted
Protestants, or that the adoption of Roman Catholicism would
mean the revolt of half the population; he considered the
religious beliefs of burghers to be but pawns in that vast
political game which was being played at that time in Europe,
and in Germany in particular, under the name of religion.
Wirtemberg was governed by a Protestant ruler, the people
regarded the Roman Faith as the religion of Antichrist, but
the nobles were nearly all Catholics; and as long as Wirtemberg
remained Protestant, they, naturally, played but small
r&ocirc;les in the government. The peasants of Wirtemberg had
more freedom than any other people of the Empire. A
heavy, stubborn race, these Wirtembergers, hating their French-speaking
rulers and jealously safeguarding those ancient rights
and liberties accorded to them by the testament of Eberhard
der Greiner in 1514. This Magna Charta of Swabia granted
the people a degree of freedom which was exceedingly irksome
to the Dukes of Wirtemberg. The nobles of the land who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
regarded themselves as too mighty to attend the petty court
of Stuttgart, for the most part sulked in their castles, or
repaired to the imperial court in Vienna. The Dukes of
Wirtemberg had perforce accepted this with as good grace as
possible, but when Eberhard Ludwig attained his majority he
welcomed foreigners from every part of Germany, forming
from this band of usually noble, but invariably penniless,
adventurers a court of a certain magnificence and brilliance.
'Here it is possible to enrich oneself; whereas in all other
courts it is impossible not to be ruined,' Monsieur de
P&ouml;llnitz tells us of the Wirtemberg of Eberhard Ludwig's
day.</p>

<p>It was in this wise that Stafforth, a man of little birth from
Hanover, had succeeded in becoming an important person, and
even pushed and intrigued himself into the high position of
Oberhofmarshall.</p>

<p>Herr Friedrich Wilhelm von Gr&auml;venitz, another courtier
and newcomer, was a gentleman of Mecklemburg. He had
served in one of the Mecklemburg regiments attached to
Marlborough's troops when that great general, with the Imperial
Army, defended the banks of the Rhine from the
invasion of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span></p>

<p>Duke Eberhard Ludwig espoused the cause of his suzerain,
the Austrian Emperor, and at the head of such troops as he
could muster out of Wirtemberg joined the Allied Army
serving under the Duke of Marlborough. On his return from
the campaign he brought with him, on a visit to Stuttgart,
several gentlemen, his comrades in arms, among whom was
Gr&auml;venitz. This young soldier having little to gain by returning
to Mecklemburg, and finding Stuttgart a pleasant abode,
remained at Eberhard Ludwig's court; married a Fr&auml;ulein von
Stuben of Rottenburg on the Neckar, hard by T&uuml;bingen; was
created Kammerjunker to the Duke, and, as we have just
seen, felt himself in spite of this office but ill-rewarded for
having taken domicile in Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>'The Church, Madame,' said the Duke of Zollern, 'is in so
sorry a plight in this country, that she will certainly be ready
to assist herself by the means you mention. But, in this case,
we are not sure if the "means" be willing; for I fear Made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>moiselle
de Gr&auml;venitz, like her brother, is of the Protestant
sect? Is that not so, Gr&auml;venitz?'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, my sister is not made of martyr stuff. I
fancy that she would be willing to further the aims of the
Church, were it in her power to do so, and if it were clearly
to her advantage. We are talking openly,' he added with a
slight flush, for he was still young, only four-and-twenty, and
more used to the ruder if more honest code of the camp, than
to court manners and customs.</p>

<p>'Now let us consider our strategics,' said Madame de Ruth.
'Bont&eacute; divine! How it refreshes one to have a scheme on
hand! Stafforth, you say nothing? Marie, you are shocked;
how foolish in this workaday world! Why, girl, each does
what he can; and, believe me, it is not a lazy life I propose for
your sister-in-law. God does not forgive the lazy&mdash;it is one
of the deadly sins&mdash;especially at court. Allons! Let us consider:
Monsieur de Stafforth remind us of the dates of the
coming court festivities! A ball? No! A ball is useful during
a well-started intrigue. I have it! there will be theatricals
in the Lusthaus on the 29th of April. Three days? Perfect!
And your sister sings? Gr&auml;venitz, how does she sing?'</p>

<p>'Well, Madame, divinely well; but her voice is deep, very
low&mdash;a dark rich voice that mad old dreamer, the schoolmaster
at G&uuml;strow, calls it&mdash;&mdash;' he began, but the garrulous
lady interrupted eagerly:</p>

<p>'Heaven guard the boy for a simpleton! Do you not know
the invincible thrill of the new, the unaccustomed? We are
all sick to death of the Geyling's shrill pipe; your sister's voice
would be invaluable, as a contrast.'</p>

<p>'When Madame de Ruth talks it is like the ripple of the
brooks,' said Zollern laughing; 'your pardon, dear friend, that
I interrupt! Your plan is admirable, but first let us get the
lady here, see her, hear her, and then we shall know what
to do. Meanwhile I must go homewards. Monsieur de Berga,
my old friend, who bores me with his virtue but holds me by
his well-tried affection, awaits me for supper, and I have a
long road before me ere I get to my house.'</p>

<p>So saying, the Duke of Zollern rose to depart. 'Berga!'
laughed Madame de Ruth, 'there is the very man we want for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
the end of our intrigue! When his Highness has plucked
the flower and enjoyed its sweetness, we will give it to Berga
to dry between the leaves of his Bible! He shall marry
Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz in a few years' time; it will be a
pious act for him, and a small reward to us for having borne
his lectures with such good grace this twenty years.' Zollern
smiled. He knew his austere old friend too well, and he could
not picture him in the ridiculous r&ocirc;le of husband of a cast-off
courtesan. With a profound salute the old beau took leave
of the company, and followed his hostess into the ill-lit
corridor.</p>

<p>'A fine plan, dear friend, a very fine plan! By the way, let
us hope this Gr&auml;venitz girl talks a little better French than
does her sister-in-law. I verily believe Madame Friedrich de
Gr&auml;venitz prefers peasant German to our own speech, and at
court no word of that inelegant language could be tolerated.'</p>

<p>Once more he bent over Madame de Ruth's hand, murmuring,
'Merci de mes souvenirs, amie bien ch&egrave;re,' and then
he climbed back into his heavy coach and drove out into the
stormy darkness. Madame de Ruth watched the lights of
the carriage disappearing, and with a sigh re-entered the salon,
where she found Gr&auml;venitz writing a letter to his sister, helped
by suggestions from Oberhofmarshall Stafforth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE AVE MARIA</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A room</span> with rudely bulging plaster walls, once painted a harsh
blue, now toned by time and damp to a hundred parti-coloured
patches. A rough, uneven floor; for furniture a narrow,
oaken bedstead, a heavy chair lamed by four legs of various
heights, a rickety table steadied by a pad of rags beneath one
foot, a long chest of painted wood: such was the sleeping-room
of Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz, in her mother's house at
G&uuml;strow in Mecklemburg. And here on a December morning
of the year 1705 Wilhelmine sat disconsolately on the edge of
the narrow bed. A feeble ray of winter sunshine crept through
the small lattice window and made the dust twirl in a straight
shaft of haze. The sunbeam kissed a cheerfulness into the
dreary chamber, but the girl evidently felt no answering thrill
of gladness, for she remained in her dejected attitude gloomily
contemplating the dust dancing in the sunray. It was bitterly
cold, and the feeble sun seemed only a teasing trick of nature,
emphasising the general unfriendliness of the morning. Wilhelmine
shivered in her thin bedgown, but she made no
movement towards clothing herself; she was a prey to a mood
of profound melancholy, and her expression was mournful,
almost sinister. Though hers was a strangely haunting face,
giving the impression of loveliness, yet, had one called this girl
beautiful, it would have conveyed a totally erroneous picture
of her, and but ill defined her subtle fascination. Her features
were irregular, a trifle heavy perchance, with high cheek bones
and massive square chin, with a cleft in the centre as though
the Master Sculptor had said: 'This were too strong a face
for a woman; I will give her a hint of tenderness to make her
utterly irresistible,' and so He had planted a child's dimple in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
her chin and another near her lips when she smiled. Wilhelmine
was over-tall, lithe of limb, and spare as a Greek runner;
then suddenly, unexpectedly, full breasted&mdash;surprising, when
one considered the rest of her proportions. Her hair was deep
brown, nearly black, save where the light showed a tinge of
red, a glint of gold. It was almost too abundant; like a rich,
virulent weed it grew triumphant. Her lips were thin yet
perfectly modelled, a long gracious curve; the upper lip a
trifle thicker and short below the sensitive, wide-open nostrils.
The brow serene and white, heavy over the deep-set blue eyes.
And the eyes! No one could ever describe Wilhelmine von
Gr&auml;venitz's eyes, or no two persons could agree concerning
them, which comes to the same thing. They were blue and
deeply set, the lids heavy, the lashes short and thick, the eyebrows
strongly marked, arched and almost joining over the
nose. But these are mere outward presentments, and tell
nothing of the spirit living in those marvellous eyes. This
was a thing of vital force, for ever changeful. Even the colour
of her eyes was varying, and yet there was a curious persistency
of gaze, a power of fixing. The G&uuml;strow citizens called
Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz witch and sorceress because of
these strange eyes; they said she could freeze men with a look,
that she had a serpent's gaze that grew cold and petrifying,
when she chose, and yet those who loved her (they were not
many) knew that her eyes could dance with laughter like a
child's, that they could soften to tenderness, could glow with
enthusiasm over a song or poem. But these softer moods
were rare; in Wilhelmine's life there was little to call forth a
gentle feeling. She lived alone with her mother in the small
dark house, her brother Friedrich was away at the wars, her
elder sister had married a middle-class personage of the name
of Sittmann, a struggling Berlin merchant; and thus Wilhelmine
led a dull life enough, for she despised the homely
G&uuml;strow citizens, who in return disliked and feared her and
called her witch. Frau von Gr&auml;venitz was a talkative dame,
who passed her days in gossip and in waiting for news of her
son Friedrich&mdash;'my soldier son at the wars with our brave
Mecklemburgians, who follow the allied army under the great
Englishman Malbruck!' as she informed her neighbours a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
hundred times a day. Upon Wilhelmine she lavished little
affection, grudging her the scanty fare, and continually reminding
her that she must marry. 'And who is more fitting a
husband than Herr Pastor M&uuml;ller?' she would add. 'Though,'
she grumbled, 'he is not of noble birth, still he is a solid man;
and really in these days, when all the country is upset and
one never knows when the French King and his wickedness
may come upon us; what with one thing and another,
indeed, a maiden may be pleased to find even a plebeian protector.'
Thus she rambled on in her sharp voice, yet there
was cause for her anxiety, and truth lay beneath her cackle,
but the wisdom of age is often obscured by its presentment.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine paid little heed to her mother's eloquence;
though this morning, as she sat on the edge of her bed, it was
of those daily tirades that she thought.</p>

<p>Frau von Gr&auml;venitz was a sore trial. The food in her
house was poor and scanty. The house itself dirty and
untidy, with one peasant girl to do all the work. Wilhelmine
hated this misery. She dreamed of ease and plenty, of soft
linen, of bright garments, of balls and masques, of gaiety and
splendour.</p>

<p>Pastor M&uuml;ller had none of these things to offer, she reflected;
and she saw in prospect long years of dull sermons to be
yawned through, stockings&mdash;thick, ugly stockings&mdash;to darn,
stuffy respectability!&mdash;A timid knock came at the door, and
Wilhelmine called the permission to enter, in a voice still
clouded and harsh from her dreary reflections. The door
opened, disclosing a curious and pathetic figure wrapped in
a tattered homespun cloak.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a child, for it had but childhood's growth; yet
the body had the clumsy decrepitude of old age. The shoulders
were high and pointed; the long, emaciated arms reached
almost to the ground. Enormous hands hung on these poor
limbs&mdash;hands for a very big woman, beautiful hands; for in
spite of their huge size they were wonderfully modelled and
imposingly strong, with the long, nervous fingers of the artist
or the enthusiast. The head was grotesquely oversized,
though essentially beautiful; but it seemed like some sculptor's
masterpiece placed upon a ridiculous figure, or some fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
boulder rock balanced absurdly on a narrow, crooked flower-stem.
The face arrested attention immediately; it was
beautiful, finely chiselled and of classic line, without a hint
of deformity or disease on its glowing health. The eyes were
large, liquid, appealing, yet painfully watchful, as are the eyes
of all the deformed. A yearning soul looked out of them,
longing for sympathy, suspicious of pity&mdash;pity which is of all
things most hateful to the cripple and the hunchback. As
she stood in the doorway, there was a look of almost stern
disapproval on her face, though the eyes softened with the
tenderness of a woman watching the gracious naughtiness
of a child.</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine,' she said, her grave glance meeting the other's
angry frown, 'Wilhelmine, what is it now? Has the mother
been singing her usual song of poverty and marriage? Come,
beloved one, never frown at me so; you know it hurts me
when you frown, more than the sneers and laughter which
I always hear around me.&mdash;My friend! Nothing is worth a
frown, though many things are worth tears.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine turned away abruptly. Anna Reinhard was her
friend, one of the few people in the world for whom she felt
affection; but the pedantic words of the deformed girl often
irritated her, and she found that spoken wisdom of Anna's
infinitely wearisome, yet she was seldom querulous to her,
partly because of the real affection she bore her, partly from a
certain fear of the hunchback's quick wit and vehemence.</p>

<p>'No,' said Wilhelmine, 'it is not really the recollection of
mother's lectures which disturbs me; but oh, Anna, this
existence is becoming unbearable! It is all very well for
you; you have your beloved books, and your religion to occupy
you, but I have got nothing, and I want so much! Believe
me, all those things you call amusement and luxury are necessities
to me. I want to lie soft in sweet linen, to wear rich
clothes, to dance, and&mdash;yes, Anna, don't look wise and solemn!
I want admiration, applause, power. Anna, Anna, I wish I
had been born like you' (the hunchback shuddered), 'yes, yes!
You know what I mean! To like those things you like, all of
which you can get&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What foolishness!' broke in Anna; 'content with what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
one can have is the only happiness. Wilhelmine, some
day perhaps you will have the things you pine for, far
more perhaps, and then you will want others, always
more!'</p>

<p>'Give me these things, and I will not ask for more!' burst
out Wilhelmine.</p>

<p>'So you always say, Wilhelmine, and always will&mdash;even
when&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Anna, you do not understand! how could you? I want
life and all that life holds&mdash;&mdash;' She opened her strange,
grasping hands, and they closed over the other's wrists in a
compelling grip.</p>

<p>At this moment a clatter arose in the narrow, ill-paved
street, in which stood Frau von Gr&auml;venitz's house.</p>

<p>A man on a mud-bespattered horse cantered to the door of
the Rathaus and pulled up with a flourish, blowing a shrill
blast on a horn. He was accoutred in the blue and silver
uniform which the Princes of Thurn and Taxis decreed to
be worn by the Imperial Post.</p>

<p>The Taxis were Hereditary Grand Masters of the Imperial
Post, which office they had found to be a valuable source of
income, for the entire return of the exorbitant postal rates
went into their pockets; still the people had cause for gratitude
to the Taxis, as, at least, their care assured a tolerably
safe carrying of letters, and, to a certain extent, a systematised
postal service.</p>

<p>In those days the arrival of the mail was an important
event. It awoke the small German town from its habitual
slumberous dullness, and a letter caused its recipient to be
regarded as a person of consequence.</p>

<p>A crowd of town cronies and gossips immediately formed
round the horseman. They did not ask if he brought a letter;
indeed, that was unlikely, but news! news of the war! What
were the Frenchmen doing? had they gone back to their
godless country?</p>

<p>The man answered these questions as best he might. He
knew little, he said, for he only carried despatches from
Schwerin. News of the war in the South? Well,&mdash;they
said in Schwerin that Marshal Villars had left Wirtemberg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
with his army, but there was a letter in his bag from Wirtemberg
for the Fr&auml;ulein von Gr&auml;venitz, and perchance she would
be able to tell them. At mention of this a busybody ran
up the narrow street, calling loudly: 'Fr&auml;ulein Wilhelmine!
Fr&auml;ulein Wilhelmine! there is a letter from your brother!
Come and tell us the news of the army. He may tell when
to expect our soldiers' return.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine, who had dressed hurriedly on hearing the post
arrive, came slowly down the street. She looked angrily at
the woman, for she hated the familiarity of the townsfolk and
resented their open curiosity. Did they expect her to read her
brother's letter aloud to a gaping group, as though it were a
public gazette? But she wanted the letter, and wished to
get it before her mother, hearing the tumult, could come and
snatch it from her. The people eyed the proud girl with no
good will. She was reserved and haughty, and some said she
had the evil eye.</p>

<p>The messenger handed her the letter and she walked quickly
away, followed by many a disapproving grunt and sarcastic
comment from the crowd. She gained the door of her mother's
house and, springing up the creaking stair, went quickly into
her room, shutting and bolting the door behind her.</p>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Sister</span>,'&mdash;she read&mdash;'Since last I wrote to thee, I
have left my Lord of Marlborough's army, being invited to
visit the court of my honoured brother in arms, Monseigneur
le Duc de Wirtemberg. This happened six months since;
meanwhile I have married Mademoiselle Marie von Stuben, a
lady of Rottenburg (a small town on the borders of my Lord
Duke's territory). I have been appointed Kammerjunker at
court, and shall not be returning to G&uuml;strow for some time. I
write this news so that thou mayst break it gently to our
mother, who, I fear, may be disappointed in that I do not
return immediately to visit her. But assure her that I will
ride North to see her whenever I can, and that shortly I hope
to be in a position to offer her hospitality in Stuttgart.</p>

<p>'I am convinced that it would be to thine advantage, dear
sister, if thou camest immediately to visit us. Tell our
mother that I know many rich noblemen here, and that I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
endeavour to arrange a marriage for thee, more fitting than the
alliance of our sister Sittmann. The great thing is that thou
shouldst set forth soon, for there will be court festivities in
the spring. After which, there is usually little gaiety until
the late autumn.</p>

<p>'A good friend of mine, Madame de Ruth of Oberhausen, is
willing to receive thee, and will arrange that thou shouldst
take part in these court gaieties. A thousand greetings to
our mother, and beg her, for my sake, to permit thee to travel
southward without too much delay.&mdash;Thy brother,</p></div>

<hr />

<p>Wilhelmine sat motionless for a few moments after she had
perused this effusion. In her mind she saw a succession of
pictures of courtly splendour and graceful adventure&mdash;and in
each she herself was the central figure. She looked around
her bare room; the bulging walls, the rude furniture. Her
eyes narrowed into that strange look of hers which the people
of G&uuml;strow declared was like a serpent's gaze, and could hold
animals powerless as long as it was directed upon them. She
was thinking deeply&mdash;swiftly&mdash;and perhaps it was at this
moment that Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz vowed her soul to
worldly success; her indomitable will directed to the goal of
worldly power at all costs and at all hazards. She rose shivering.
It was cheerless and cold in her room; the momentary
gleam of the winter sun had died away, and the sky was grey
and heavy with coming snow. She unhooked her cloak from
the peg, fastened it round her, and with her letter hidden
away in the folds she stepped softly out and down the stair,
throwing a quick backward glance to see if her mother followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
or observed her. Noiselessly she lifted the latch of the house
door and took her way up the narrow street.</p>

<p>She passed the old Rathaus with the quaint fourteenth-century
belfry, and the clock whence sprang out the brightly
painted leaden figure of a knight, to smite the chime with his
sword at each hour. In the market-place beneath, the weekly
market was being held<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins></p>

<p>Many small booths had been erected, and the venders were
expostulating with the citizens, who drove hard bargains with
them. It was a picturesque scene enough, had Wilhelmine
paused to watch&mdash;much colour in the peasants' dress, much
variety in the women's headgear, and over all the wonderful
old building, which would have delighted a painter's soul.
That morning Wilhelmine noted nothing of all this, though
on another occasion she would have taken pleasure in it,
for like most sensuous natures she had a keen feeling for
colour, and the grouping of a peasant crowd appealed to her
artistic eye; but that day she was so absorbed in her own
dreams that she did not even observe her mother walking
towards her, an expression of annoyance on her sharp features.
Wilhelmine started when Frau von Gr&auml;venitz, laying an
ungentle hand on her shoulder, said close to her ear: 'And
where may my fine daughter be going at so early an hour?
Generally Miss Lie-abed is still reposing at nine of the clock!'</p>

<p>'O mother!' she answered, 'I am going to Monsieur
Gabriel for my singing lesson. God knows, you cannot grudge
me that, for he teaches me without payment.' Her quick wit
told her that to draw her mother's attention to this fruitful
source of complaint, her poverty, would ensure an escape
unquestioned. She reflected that she could tell of Friedrich's
letter, pretending she had received it on her way home. Or,
if her mother discovered the earlier delivery of the post, she
would say the angry attack in the market-place had made
her forget to mention it. This plan met with success, and
Frau von Gr&auml;venitz remained in the pleasurable throes of a
talkative woman with a grievance, holding forth to an appreciative
audience composed of several of her gossips, who had
gathered round as soon as they heard her shrill excited tones.
A market-woman or two joined the group and stood with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
hands on hips, listening with open amusement, for the garrulous
dame was a well-known character in the country town.</p>

<p>As Wilhelmine gained the shelter of the dark street which
ran from the Marktplatz to the cathedral, she saw Pastor
M&uuml;ller's fat form added to her mother's assemblage. How she
hated that stout person, his pompous condescension to her,
and his greasy face!</p>

<p>The Klosterstrasse seemed deliciously quiet after the noise
of the Marktplatz, and before her, at the end of the street, she
could see one tall buttress of the cathedral, and a corner of the
graveyard. She walked up the pathway between the tombs
and pushed open the heavy church door. The cathedral nave
was dark. Wilhelmine peered about and, thinking there was
no one in the church, turned to go, when from the organ, far
away near the high altar (or where the high altar had been
before Protestant fury had torn it down), came a whisper like
the awakening of the cathedral's soul; a long-drawn note
which grew stronger and fuller, filling the whole building with
a pulse of sound.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine paused, then, turning silently to one of the
oaken pews, sat down. A wondrous melody crept through
the air, strong, noble, uncomplicated; then followed chords
growing each moment more the expression of a soul on fire.
They rose stronger, they swelled and strove and implored, they
wailed with the passion of finite hearts that yearn infinitely;
then suddenly sank back into the solemn major key whence
they started. And it was as the renunciation of some terrible
striving, as though the organ chanted the litany of some perfect
calm reached through an agony of endeavour and suffering.
Wilhelmine's eyes were wet, while she leaned her head against
the back of the oaken pew. To her music was the only form
of prayer, and it never failed to move her to a vague aspiration,
she herself knew hardly what. Her dreams of the world faded,
and she was only cognisant of the dim church and the inspired
improvisation of her beloved Monsieur Gabriel. This was his
answer to her as yet unasked question. She had come to him
for guidance, to beg his counsel concerning her brother's letter,
and he had told her in his music all that he knew of the world.
He had shown her the cruel agony of the worldly life, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
unrest, the bootless seeking, the satiety of realised ambition,
and the calmness, the peace of the renunciation of these things.</p>

<p>The organ was silent for a moment, and then through the
stillness of the shadowy aisle floated the first notes of an 'Ave
Maria,' which Wilhelmine knew well and had often sung when
no disturbing element of disapproving Protestant burgherdom
was near. Instinctively she came in at the appointed bar for
the voice's commencement. 'Ave Maria gratia plena,' she
sang, and her powerful notes echoed through the cathedral with
all the sombre glory which lay in her great contralto voice.
The player at the organ immediately softened his music to a
mere accompanying whisper, which yet supported the voice,
greeting it with the newly awakened soul of the organ. 'Ora
pro nobis, peccatoribus,' she sang, and surely the Mother of
God must have listened to so wonderful a tone prayer? 'Nunc
et in hora mortis nostrae, Amen.' And the organ wandered
on repeating the 'Amen' again and again in a solemn, dreamy
deepening of chords, which the beautiful voice followed and
answered with that certainty and ease which belong to a few
of the world's singers when they sing to the accompaniment of
one with whom they are in perfect musical and sympathetic
understanding. The music came to an end and the church
seemed doubly silent, with the painful stillness one sometimes
feels when a song is ended; it is almost the same sudden forlorn
feeling as when a beloved friend goes away, that sense of
the departure of a beautiful presence, or it may be that our
souls have returned to earth after soaring towards some
beauteous mystic region. Wilhelmine passed up the nave,
through a small door in the side of the carven wooden screen,
and up a dark and narrow winding stair which led to the
organ-loft. It was unusual to find an organ even in a cathedral
in those days, but a pious Duke of Mecklemburg-G&uuml;strow
had given this one to the church as a thankoffering, and had
caused it to be built by the famous organ-makers of Venice.</p>

<p>The organist's face and figure commanded attention. Tall
and spare, with the scholar's stoop, a long narrow head broadening
at the brow, a mass of iron-grey hair,&mdash;a thin, eager face
lit by almost colourless eyes, which looked as though the blue
of youth had been washed away by tears, or faded by vigils and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
patient suffering. This was the individual whom the townsfolk
called the 'mad French schoolmaster, Monsieur Gabriel,'
and whose youth they whispered had been spent at the court
of France, till Madame de Maintenon had set his enemies
upon him, and he, being proved a heretic, had fled for his life
across the frontier and wandered northwards. The course of
his wanderings brought him to Mecklemburg where, hearing
that the schoolmaster at G&uuml;strow had died, he had sought the
post and it had been granted him, because of his proved
learning and his skill as a musician. This uneventful calling
he had followed for many years, and the people had ceased to
wonder at his eccentricities, his silence, and his friendlessness.
The children loved him, and his school became famous through
the countryside, and on Sundays and feast days the citizens
flocked to hear his organ playing, and the performance of the
choir of youths and maidens he had trained to sing so well.</p>

<p>Pastor M&uuml;ller, according to his coarse nature, was jealous
of him and insolent to him, yet he feared the mild gaze of
those faded eyes and the imperturbable courtesy of the old
Frenchman's manner. The pastor would often question the
schoolmaster sharply concerning the music he played. 'Chorales
are all very fine,' he said, 'but surely oftentimes you play
music from the abominable Mass, not fitting indeed in a holy
place set apart for the worship of the Lord according to our
pure faith?' 'Ah! Pastor, but the notes cannot contaminate,'
Monsieur Gabriel would answer; 'Luther himself made use of
the monk's melodies in his canticles.' And Pastor M&uuml;ller
retired to his dirty, airless house, feeling rebuked himself
where he had wished to chide.</p>

<p>When Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz appeared at the G&uuml;strow
school, a curly-haired child, Monsieur Gabriel had immediately
fallen victim to her wayward charm, and had lavished
much care on her studies. He taught her French thoroughly.
'I am told,' he was wont to say, 'that even in Germany no
lady speaks aught save French, and you, my child, must be
a great lady some day. Believe me, there is no more magnificent
being than a true <i>grande dame</i>, and for this destiny the
good God fashioned you.' He trained Wilhelmine in music,
till thorough-bass, counterpoint, and the rest became to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
an easy exercise. He read her of the history of France;
taught her to know and love the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>, and the
poems of the singers of La Ple&iuml;ade. Often he would quote
Malherbes, saying with a smile and a sigh as he looked at her
radiant youth: 'Et rose, elle a v&eacute;cu ce que vivent les roses,
l'espace d'un matin; for,' he said, 'the flowers of the world fade
quickly, and thou art surely a flower, my little one.' He read
her the works of Racine, Corneille, Moli&egrave;re, all of which learning
she assimilated rapidly, and with an accuracy which
delighted the old scholar. Sometimes, of an evening, he would
keep her with him long after school hours, and one winter he
took it into his head that she must learn to dance. He tied
an inky tablecloth to her shoulders to serve as a sweeping
garment. It was infinitely droll to see the two, mincing,
bowing, and pirouetting in front of the mirror. 'You must
<i>see</i> yourself curtsey,' he said, 'if you would learn the real
movement.' He taught her the gavotte, the pavane, and
many other dances, playing the measures on an old violin the
while. The school desks served for dummy dancers, and were
arranged to give her a notion of the ordering of the figures.
The aged recluse, in his musty coat, seemed transformed into
a very courtly gentleman, but Wilhelmine always fancied that
his eyes were more melancholy than usual after these mimic
courts. One day she asked him if it saddened him to revoke
the past. 'Ah! mon enfant!' he replied, 'que voulez-vous? un
c&oelig;ur profond&eacute;ment bless&eacute; ne gu&eacute;rit jamais; and the melodies
of these dances remind me of my wound, which I thought had
healed in your peaceful northern land. Ah! little one, there
is no sadder music to the old than the dance-music of a
vanished youth.'</p>

<p>While Wilhelmine read her brother's letter on that cold
December morning, it was to Monsieur Gabriel she at once
decided to confide its surprising contents. Her mother, she
knew, would raise a dozen difficulties, and it were best to talk
with Monsieur Gabriel and devise some means of procuring
sufficient money to pay the cost of her journey to Wirtemberg.
Then, if they could hit upon a scheme to propose to Frau von
Gr&auml;venitz, there was more likelihood of gaining her consent.
But the music had changed Wilhelmine's mind, and as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
climbed up to the organ-loft she was almost prepared to
abandon her intended journey.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Gabriel!' she said, 'I have great news, so
strangely unexpected that I wonder if I am dreaming it!
Read this letter of my brother's, and give me your advice.' The
old man stretched out his left hand to take the paper, while
his right hand remained on the organ keys, and as he read he
played a few chords. 'H&eacute;las!' he murmured as he refolded
the letter, 'so the time has come when you must go forth
into the world. Well, well&mdash;it is right; you are wasted here,
though God knows it will be very dark without you.'</p>

<p>'But, Monsieur Gabriel,' she said, 'you talk as though I
should start to-morrow! I have not told my mother yet, and
I have come to you for advice. Where could I get the money
to pay my journey? It will cost many gulden.'</p>

<p>The old man smiled. 'Money? your brother sends you
none, of course? Your mother? she also has none. Does
Friedrich think you can fly southward on a swallow's wing?
And the swallows have gone to the south long ago,' he added
dreamily.</p>

<p>'O Monsieur Gabriel,' cried Wilhelmine, 'help me!&mdash;you
have always helped me! tell me where to get this money.'</p>

<p>'My child, I must think; do you know what the cost will
be? No, nor I either; but let me see&mdash;how long has this letter
been on the road?&mdash;sixteen days&mdash;and you could not travel
so far without rest and refreshment. Well! you must have
a hundred gulden. But, child, to what am I sending you?'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine started; she knew by his last words that he
could procure the money.</p>

<p>'To success!' she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>'Success? Yes, probably, but that is the greatest danger!
We can most of us remain pure of heart, tender, generous
while we are poor or sad, but it is when the world smiles that
the heart so often grows cold and hard.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine clambered on to the organ bench, pushing
Monsieur Gabriel gently aside. She struck a chord, but the
half-witted bellows-blower, whose presence they had forgotten,
had ceased to pump air into the organ, and there came only a
painful droning from the empty pipes. She called to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
imperiously, and with a muttered grumble he resumed his
pumping.</p>

<p>'A bad omen,' said Wilhelmine; 'I strike a chord and I
achieve dissonance and wailing.' She threw back her head
and pressed her fingers on the keyboard: this time a thin
flute-like chord came forth, and Wilhelmine lifted her voice
and sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Cher ami de ma jeunesse</p>
<p class="ihalf">Souriez &agrave; ma liesse&mdash;</p>
<p class="ihalf">Au Printemps chansons et fleurs!</p>
<p class="ihalf">Pour l'hiver gardons les pleurs.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="ihalf">Cher ami, la vieillesse</p>
<p class="ihalf">Est rev&ecirc;che &agrave; l'al&eacute;gresse</p>
<p class="ihalf">Je cueillerai les douces fleurs</p>
<p class="ihalf">Pour l'hiver gardant mes pleurs.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>She managed the organ wonderfully, and succeeded so well
in playing a light, graceful accompaniment to the old French
melody, that Monsieur Gabriel, listening with a smile and
nodding his head, whispered as though to some invisible confidant:
'I have made her a true artist!&mdash;no, God makes the
artist, but those who love them teach them to give their
genius to the world. Well, my child,' he continued, 'I will
find the money for you, but leave me now. Be satisfied, your
song has done its work; I will send you on your search for
the flowers, and God grant you may not find the tears too
soon!&mdash;I do not love that song with its refrain of fleurs et
pleurs, it is so terribly true.' But Wilhelmine was not listening
to his rambling talk; her strange eyes had lost the brightness
which had been theirs while she sang the gay French
song; they had narrowed to that hard, compelling gaze which,
in truth, was curiously serpent-like in its cold fixity.</p>

<p>Monsieur Gabriel laid his hand on her shoulder, and together
they went down into the silent nave of the church. They
separated at the door; the old man going up the Klosterstrasse
to the schoolhouse, while Wilhelmine walked rapidly
away, through the graveyard, towards the bleak fields and the
marshland which surrounded the dreary northern town.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilhelmine</span> walked on for some twenty minutes, the cold
morning air bringing a bright colour to her cheeks and a
sparkle to her eyes. Her gait was one of her greatest charms;
it never seemed hurried, and yet the long, even steps carried
her swiftly onwards. There was vigorous elasticity in her
tread; she walked freely and with perfectly assured balance,
her shoulders thrown back and head erect. It was in a
measure this walk of hers which caused the townsfolk to call
her 'the proud hussy,' though they were careful not to let her
hear their disparaging remarks, for they feared the compelling
power of her strange eyes. It was whispered that it was
dangerous to offend her. 'Though, of course,' they declared,
'we do not really believe in witchcraft and such Popish
abominations, still it is certainly true that Hans Frisch, the
blacksmith's child, who threw a snowball at her last winter
and had the misfortune to hit her on the face, went home,
took to his bed, and nearly died of convulsions.' Of this
talk Wilhelmine was unaware, though, knowing the effect of
her eyes upon people, she would often voluntarily narrow her
lids, causing the pupils to contract. She practised this feat
before the mirror, but she was careful not to do so at night,
for it gave her an uncanny feeling, and she sometimes succeeded
in frightening herself, as she did others. That cold morning,
while she walked, there was none of all this in her face; she
was merely a gloriously healthy young being rejoicing simply
and naturally in the morning freshness and in the pulsing of
the blood in her veins. She was feeling the elation of health,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>
and it chased away her morbid fancies in spite of the dreariness
of the wet fields around her. Indeed, it needed the buoyancy
of youth to counteract the profound melancholy of the Mecklemburg
lake-country in winter. The enormous flat fields
stretching away in unbroken monotony, the road very straight,
with a division of colour in the middle where the summer
road marched with the winter road; the former merely a
soaking mud-bog, the latter hard and stony. On each side of
the highway a line of apple and pear trees lifted gaunt twisted
arms to the leaden sky, as though in protest against the sullen
aspect of the world. Wilhelmine paused and looked about
her. The snow was surely coming; there was the hush in the
air which precedes a snowstorm, and she was some distance
from home. She strained her eyes westward and endeavoured
to catch a glimpse of the lake towards which she was journeying,
but she could see nothing save the drenched fields, and in
the dim distance the dark line of fir woods. She turned her
face homewards and began to walk with a quickened step.
The cold air had made her hungry; she had only partaken of
a lump of black bread and a glass of milk, and it was now late
in the morning. She felt a soft cold touch on her cheek, the
first snowflake of the gathering storm. At first the snowflakes
only added to the slush on the road; they melted shudderingly
and were devoured by the brown mud, but as the snow
fell the mud was conquered and lay hidden beneath a dazzling
white covering. Ever faster came the snow. It beat down
on Wilhelmine, the large fleecy patches almost blinding her.
She had walked farther than she had realised, and her feet
sinking deep through the snow into the mud beneath, the
high heels of her thin shoes stuck and impeded her progress.
At length she reached the outskirts of the town, whose red
roofs were already almost hidden by a white layer of snow.
She hurried up the deserted street, past the cathedral. When
she came to the corner of the market-place she saw a dark
figure in a cloak of peasant's frieze coming towards her, and
with a feeling of annoyance she recognised Pastor M&uuml;ller.</p>

<p>At that moment he too observed her, and hurried to meet
her. 'Ah! Fr&auml;ulein,' he said as he came up, 'I am grieved
to see you exposed to this inclement weather. May I not offer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
you the hospitality of my house?' He spoke in German with
a careful affectation of correctness, though his accent was harsh
and guttural from his native low German dialect. Wilhelmine
particularly detested his speech, and it irritated her to be
addressed as 'Fr&auml;ulein,' as though she were a burgher's
daughter, and not of sufficiently noble birth to be styled
'gracious lady.' Of a truth, the pastor was not a person to
inspire either liking or respect. He was fat in body, with
short plump legs whose common shape was exhibited to the
fullest extent by tight knee-breeches and woollen stockings.
His face was enormous, and though his jaw showed strength
and decision, the weak mouth and large protuberant lips indicated
that his senses ruled what he himself styled 'the fair
habitation of an immortal soul.' His eyes were small, and
seemed to express inordinate greed, when they were not, as
was usually the case, lifted to the sky in pious self-assurance,
yet with feigned humility. Pastor M&uuml;ller was at once unctuous
and insolent, a combination of contending characteristics which
is often the possession of those who patronise God Almighty
with their approval, and use His Name as a convenient adjunct
in their homilies against all things human. His health, he
was wont to declare, had suffered from his many vigils, and
consequently he found himself forced to fortify his body with
much nourishment, and with copious draughts of any wine
which he could obtain. In spite of this, he dominated his
congregation partly by reason of a certain eloquence which
was at his command in the pulpit when dealing with theological
questions, in which, indeed, he was deeply learned.
He convinced by his uncompromising attitude towards the
sinful members of his parish. In fact, the G&uuml;strow citizens
regarded him as a strong Christian, and rejoiced in his fervid
biblical language. Many of the spinsters of his flock would
gladly have become Frau M&uuml;ller, but he paid no heed to their
blandishments, and openly avowed his intention of making
Wilhelmine the mistress of the Pfarrhaus, though she appeared
strangely insensible to the glory of this prospect<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins> In the first
place, with the arrogance of youth, she regarded the pastor's
forty years as old age, and treated his ponderous attempts at
gallantry with levity. However, when she met him in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
snow that morning she was cold and hungry, and the prospect
of probable warmth at his fireside, with a substantial meal
provided, proved alluring; so it was with an unusually gracious
manner that she accepted his offer of shelter. A few steps
brought them to the door of his abode, and they passed into
the small, dark corridor which led to his study. Here the
stove sent forth a pleasant heat, and it was with a welcome
sensation of returning warmth that Wilhelmine sank down in
the large chair which the pastor drew up for her close to the
stove. She had flung off her snow-covered cloak, and she sat
there in her thin morning blouse, open at the neck and showing
the contour of her white throat. M&uuml;ller begged her to
remove her soaking shoes, and, having done so, she leaned
back, stretching out her feet towards the little door in the
stove, which he had opened in order to permit the red embers
to give forth their full heat. He pushed some logs through
the aperture, and there was a delightful crackling and the
busy burning of well-dried wood. Then he left Wilhelmine
while he went to forage in the kitchen for food; his old house-keeper
being at the market, or more probably sheltering from
the storm and gossiping in some friendly booth. Wilhelmine
reclined in the comfortable chair and surveyed the room. A
number of theological works lay on the table in the centre of
the apartment; and another large table which stood in the
window was covered with papers, closely written sheets as
her sharp eyes observed. The walls were bare and ugly, but
the room had a decided air of comfort; the windows shut out
the cold in a manner unknown in Frau von Gr&auml;venitz's
dilapidated house; the chair she lay in was soft; and, above
all, it was very warm in the room. She stretched herself and
wondered if, after all, there would not be sufficient creature
comforts to atone for the dullness of life as Frau M&uuml;ller.</p>

<p>The pastor returned carrying a dish of cold meat, a loaf of
home-baked bread, and under his arm a large bottle. Pushing
some of the theological books aside, he set down the food
on the middle table which he drew up near the stove beside
Wilhelmine. Then again he disappeared to the kitchen,
returning anon with plates, glasses, knives and forks. He
placed himself opposite his guest, and turning his eyes towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
the grimy ceiling, he folded his fat hands and recited a prayer
over the victuals.</p>

<p>'O Lord, who hath brought this female into mine house,
send a blessing, I pray thee, upon the food which I set before
her!' He paused, then added: 'May this be the first of many
meals she shall partake of here in Christian humility and
dutiful affection.' Wilhelmine laughed. At another time
the pastor would have been rebuked sharply for a speech of
this kind; but she was hungry, and it did not suit her to
postpone her meal to the uncertain date of Frau von Gr&auml;venitz's
dinner. The pastor helped her liberally to meat, and cut a
large slice from the white loaf&mdash;a luxury for Wilhelmine, used
to the heavy, sour, black bread, which was provided in her
mother's house. He poured out a copious draught from the
black bottle, and the smell of corn brandy filled the air.
Wilhelmine ate hungrily, and drank the liquor with relish, the
strong spirits coursing through her with a grateful, tingling
feeling, for she was really in need of food.</p>

<p>'Dear lady,' said M&uuml;ller, pouring a large quantity of the
brandy into his own glass, 'I give you of my best; this excellent
liquor was a present to me from the noble Herr von Maltzan.
He is a generous friend to me. But truly, this beverage is not
for those whom the Lord has blessed with health and strength,
and I keep it for the use of the sick, though my own delicate
constitution demands, at rare intervals, a small amount
to strengthen me. Dear Fr&auml;ulein, I give it gladly to you this
morning, for it is cruelly cold, and you, my dear one, were
exposed to the rigours of the storm.'</p>

<p>'I thank you, Herr Pastor; I feel truly better for your breakfast,
though my head is going round a little, I must confess,'
said Wilhelmine.</p>

<p>M&uuml;ller looked at her curiously, then, rising, he walked to
the window, and watched the driving snow. After a few
moments he returned, and drawing up his chair near the stove
he spread out his fat fingers, warming them at the fire. There
was silence between them, only broken by the wind outside,
which had risen and was whistling and howling, and driving
the snow in clouds down the street. Suddenly the pastor
bent down and laid his hand on her stockinged foot. 'Still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
damp,' he said; 'it would be well if you took off your hose
and dried them.' Wilhelmine smiled lazily.</p>

<p>'Good Herr Pastor,' she said, 'your plenteous meal has made
me sleepy. I cannot take the trouble to take off my hose even
though they may be a trifle wet.' She closed her eyes. The
walk in the strong winter air, followed by the warmth of the
room and the unaccustomed alcohol made her drowsy, and she
wished to be undisturbed in her half dream. M&uuml;ller's face
flushed to a deep purple, then paled. He breathed heavily,
and the veins stood out on his temples like cords.</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine,' he said in a hoarse, thick whisper, 'you shall
indeed be my wife&mdash;I promise you&mdash;ah, you are fitted to
adorn any position, Wilhelmine, my bride!' He bent and
kissed her stockinged foot, and his coarse fingers pressed deep
into her slight ankle.</p>

<p>'Your condescension amazes me, Herr Pastor,' she said
mockingly, 'but I fear&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nay, my dear, no maidenly modesty! Come, we are affianced
now; let me give thee the lover's kiss!' He leaned over her.
His breath was sour with the smell of corn brandy. His eyes
were glassy, staring, and his fat face was livid, hideous. An
overwhelming sense of repulsion came to her. She felt herself
degraded by this man's admiration, smirched by his odious
desire. The recollection flashed through her mind of a white
flower she had seen&mdash;a gracious, delicate thing&mdash;and a huge,
slimy, black slug had rested on the petals. She remembered
how she had knocked the creature away, feeling that it defiled
the flower.</p>

<p>'No, never! do you hear? Never! I will not marry you,'
she broke out.</p>

<p>She struggled to remove M&uuml;ller's hand from her ankle; but
he gripped strongly, and her fingers seemed terribly impotent,
childishly weak.</p>

<p>'How dare you! Let me go. I tell you I will never marry
you,' she reiterated vehemently.</p>

<p>'Ah! you beautiful wild thing&mdash;but I will make you love
me&mdash;you will see how you will love your husband. Come,
no nonsense! I will soon show you how you love me.' He
loosed his grip of her ankle and flung himself over her in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
the chair, endeavouring to press his thick lips to hers. She
struggled against him but he kept her down; with one hand
on her forehead he pushed her back into the chair, while with
the other he wrenched open the neck of her bodice, tearing it
downward to her breast. Always a strong man he seemed
now transformed into some ruthless, degraded, maddened
animal. Apparently she was entirely at his mercy, but she
was strong and young, and angry disgust gave her unusual
strength. She caught the man's throat in both her hands,
working her knuckles inwards on his windpipe with such
force that he was almost choked, and instinctively put up his
hands to hers endeavouring to remove her grip. But she held
him, and, half-throttled, he sank down sideways on the arm of
the chair. In an instant she dragged herself from him and
was able to raise herself on one knee, still keeping her hold
on his throat. He wrenched away her hands, his iron grip
on both her wrists, but she was now able to dominate her
aggressor from above and could hold him down with the full
force of her arms. Face to face with her enemy, she recalled
the potency of her witch-gaze. She narrowed her eyelids and
directed her steely glance into the bloodshot eyes of her
tormentor. During a few seconds they were thus: the girl
half-standing, half-kneeling, rigid, tense, holding the man from
her with all her strength. The man sprawling on his side in
the chair&mdash;a huge, ridiculous being, panting, gasping, helpless,
for he could not regain his balance unless he let go the
woman's wrists. To Wilhelmine, in spite of her dauntless
nature, these few seconds seemed endless. Fortunately for her,
no misgivings as to the compelling power of her eyes crossed
her mind, or probably her force might thereby have been
diminished. At length she felt a slackening of the muscles of
M&uuml;ller's hands&mdash;his gaze faltered. Again he struggled frantically.
She resolved to hazard everything, trusting entirely in
her strange power. She bent slowly downwards, all the force
of her will focused in her eyes. She felt as though each eye
held a dagger wherewith she could stab her enemy<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing apostrophe">'s</ins> very
consciousness. Another moment and the man's hands relaxed
entirely and fell limp and inert from her wrists. She sprang
up, catching her cloak in her hand as she fled. She reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
study door before M&uuml;ller moved. For the moment he seemed
transfixed, but as she opened the door, to her horror she saw
him rise, and as she rushed down the short passage she heard
M&uuml;ller's heavy step behind her. For the first time during the
whole disgusting scene she felt afraid. Her knees seemed to
fail, her feet to grow strangely heavy. She stumbled on till
she gained the house door. She fumbled frantically at the
latch; it was unfamiliar to her and she could not unfasten it.
The pursuer was up to her now and his breath was on her
cheek. Once more he threw his arms round her. She turned,
like an animal at bay, and dealt M&uuml;ller a blow full on the lips.
He staggered for an instant, and she succeeded, at last, in
wrenching open the door. He clutched at her skirt as she
sprang out. It unbalanced her, and she fell forward on her
face into the snow of the street.</p>

<hr />

<p>The shock of the fall, following the excitement of her struggle
with M&uuml;ller, stunned Wilhelmine for a moment, and when she
dragged herself up to a kneeling position and looked round,
she found herself alone in the driving snow. M&uuml;ller's door
was shut, and the street absolutely deserted. She rubbed the
clinging snow off her face and ruefully considered the distance
which lay between her and her mother's house. The snow had
soaked through her thin stockings. She rose wearily, and
drawing her cloak round her, and over her head, she hid both
her torn bodice and her thick unbound hair, which had fallen
over her shoulders during her struggle with M&uuml;ller.</p>

<p>Then she started homewards through the fast-falling snow.
As she passed the market-place, many faces peered out at her
from the venders' booths, and one friendly peasant woman
called to her to take shelter, but Wilhelmine shook her head
and hastened onwards. She feared that her shoeless feet would
awaken curiosity, and she dared not let the people see her torn
garments as they assuredly would did she tarry in the booth,
for in their homely kindness they would insist on removing her
wet cloak.</p>

<p>The Rathaus clock chimed the hour, and Wilhelmine realised
with a strange, dream-like feeling that but three hours had
gone by since she passed that way to visit Monsieur Gabriel.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
Yet it seemed to her as though days had elapsed since she
sang the <i>Ave Maria</i> in the cathedral. At length she reached
the door of her mother's house. She knocked loudly, wondering
if Frau von Gr&auml;venitz had watched her from the windows
of the upper story, which commanded a view of part of the
market-place and the door of the Rathaus, where she had received
her brother's letter that morning. She knocked again
and tried to lift the latch, but it was secured within. She
listened, but could hear no approaching footsteps in the corridor.
She leaned against the portal, and wondered if it was her fate
to remain in the snow for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought came to her, which sent the blood
tingling in a hot wave to her cheeks: Where was her brother's
letter? She felt for it in her bosom; it was not there, and she
knew the precious missive must have fallen from her gown
during the struggle at the Pfarrhaus. Could she go back and
fetch it? she asked herself. No! that was out of the question.</p>

<p>At this moment the door was flung open and Frau von
Gr&auml;venitz appeared. 'Lord God!' she said, when she saw
Wilhelmine standing on the threshold, 'where have you been
child? Surely your dear Monsieur Gabriel could keep you in
the schoolhouse till this storm passed over, and not send you
back to catch your death of cold or cost me an apothecary's <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: removed extraneous comma">fee!</ins>'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine pushed past her mother without a word, designing
to gain her chamber before the old woman observed her
torn garments and her lack of shoes; but Frau von Gr&auml;venitz
clutched hold of the cloak and, giving it a vicious pull, exclaimed:
'No, no! I will not permit you to take your soaking
clothes upstairs. Come in here and take them off.' She <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tuggted'">tugged</ins>
at the heavy cloak with such vehemence that the clasp at her
neck parted and the cape fell back, revealing Wilhelmine's
loosened hair and her torn bodice. The old woman saw her
daughter's shoeless feet. She looked at her searchingly, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he'">her</ins>
face darkening and hardening from annoyance to real anger
and distrust. 'Wilhelmine,' she said harshly, 'explain your
extraordinary appearance. Where have you been, and why do
you come home in this strange and unbecoming manner?'</p>

<p>'Mother,' answered the girl, 'let me take off my wet clothes
and I will tell you everything.' She wished to gain time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
concoct a plausible story, for she did not intend to mention
M&uuml;ller's outbreak.</p>

<p>In the first place she was horribly ashamed, and knowing
Frau von Gr&auml;venitz's garrulous tongue she feared to be made
the subject of the citizens' gossip. But her mother was not to
be put off so easily. She drew the girl into the kitchen, and
after shutting the larder door in the servant-maid's astonished
face, she planted herself firmly in front of Wilhelmine. 'Now,'
she said, 'you will favour me with your story. It is strange
to see a young maiden return in this state of disarray from an
interview with a man, and I insist upon your clearing yourself
immediately if you can.'</p>

<p>'Interview with a man, mother?' said Wilhelmine; 'what
do you mean?' It flashed across her that Frau von Gr&auml;venitz
must have seen her enter M&uuml;ller's house.</p>

<p>'Yes; your fine Monsieur Gabriel, with his mincing airs and
his high manners! You go to him for your studies, after two
long hours you return looking as though&mdash;&mdash;Good Lord! child!
answer me&mdash;what has that evil old Frenchman done to you?'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine looked at her for a moment in silence; it
had not struck her that this interpretation of her dishevelled
appearance could be harboured even in her mother's suspicious
mind. It filled her with indignation and dismay for
her friend; yet she realised with surprise that, could such a
thing have occurred as for Monsieur Gabriel to lose his self-control
and offend as M&uuml;ller had, it would not have disgusted
her to the same extent. Somehow, she felt it would not have
debased her and humiliated her as had the pastor's attack. For
a moment she almost decided to let her mother suspect there
had been some strange scene with the organist; anything better
than own to the degradation of having suffered the insult of
the greasy burgher. Then with a revulsion of feeling, her
soul sickened at the injustice of letting Monsieur Gabriel pay
the penalty of the pastor's wicked insolence, and she remembered
that her friend would be exposed to the horrified reprobation
of the sober townsfolk; nay, more, he might even be
dismissed from his post.</p>

<p>'How can you think such a thing, mother?' she said angrily.
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins>I tell you Monsieur Gabriel knows nothing of all this, and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
you put such an odious construction on my appearance, I shall
not give you the satisfaction of telling you how it came about.'</p>

<p>'As you wish,' the other replied icily; 'but it will be my
duty to forbid any further visits to that Frenchman, and I shall
inform Pastor M&uuml;ller of the schoolmaster's real character.'</p>

<p>This was too much for Wilhelmine; her anger flamed, all
her reticence vanished, and she poured forth the whole story.
Her mother heard her to the end, and, shaking her head, she
made answer: 'If this be true, Pastor M&uuml;ller should be punished.
But I cannot credit it; you are shielding Monsieur Gabriel.
Now go to your room and reflect. You are a sinful woman,
Wilhelmine, and a disgrace to your ancient name.'</p>

<p>The girl turned away. The excitement of the last hours
had fatigued her, and she felt an unaccountable apathy.
After all, what did it matter if her mother misjudged her?
She would soon be far away; her present life and surroundings
appeared to her to be absolutely detached from her
real self. She went slowly up the creaking stair and into
her garret, and flung herself down on the bed. She was
asleep almost as soon as her head touched the pillow.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was quite dark when Wilhelmine woke, and she wondered
why she should awaken during the night; then, slowly, remembrance
came to her, and she realised that she was still fully
dressed. She lay quiet for some time, pondering on the events
of the day. The Rathaus clock chimed eight slow notes, and
she knew she had slept for nearly nine hours. She listened;
there was some one moving downstairs in the kitchen, probably
her mother preparing the meagre supper. Wilhelmine rose,
groped her way to the door, and turned the handle. The door
remained firmly closed. She shook it gently, pushed it&mdash;the
doors in her mother's house often stuck fast; but this time it
was no accidental adherence of ill-fitting hinges, the door was
securely fastened from outside. Her mother had locked her
in! To be locked into a room had always been a terrible
thing to her. When she was a child, her brother had often
teased her by pushing her into a dark cupboard and turning
the key, and it was the only one of the many tricks he played
her which had caused her real alarm. She hated the dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
and always imagined she was stifling when she knew she was
a prisoner in an unlit place. The same feeling came over her
now, and she beat her hands frantically against the door,
calling her mother loudly the while. But no answer came.
She groped her way across the room till she felt her hand
touch the window. She found the fastening and, opening the
casement, leaned far out into the still night air. From across
the market-place came the sound of men's voices, and a glow
of light shone beneath the hostelry door. An occasional burst
of song and drunken laughter told her that the bad characters
of the town were carousing, as usual, on a Saturday night.
Otherwise the silence was intense and the darkness unbroken
by moon or star. The calm air of the winter night soothed
Wilhelmine, and she was ashamed of having knocked and
called so wildly; but now a dull feeling of resentment rose in
her against her mother for locking her into her room like a
naughty child. She leaned her head against the window-frame
and wondered if any one on earth had ever been as lonely and
miserable as she. Her mother disliked her, her brother was
too selfish to care for any one save himself. Anna, her friend,
was something in her life; but it is small avail to be loved by
those who manage to make their affection tiresome. M&uuml;ller
loved her! She smiled bitterly to herself; yes, that was a love
which could give her happiness! That was what some people
called love, she had been told. All at once a wonderful feeling
came to her, a wave of infinite relief, like balsam to her wounded
heart: it was the thought of Monsieur Gabriel's gentle friendship
and trust in her. She saw his kind, dim eyes; the good,
discriminating smile, and the thought was as though he laid
his delicate, blue-veined hand on her head, soothing her unutterably.
She heard a step coming on the stair, a flicker of light
crept under her door, and some one fitted the key into the lock.
'Mother!' she called in a softened voice. When the door
opened, she saw Frau von Gr&auml;venitz standing there, a rush-light
in one hand and a plate of food balanced between her
breast and the other hand, in which she held a pitcher of milk.
The old woman's eyes were red with weeping, and vaguely
Wilhelmine realised for the first time in her life that, in spite
of grumbling, reproaches, and grudging meanness, her mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
had for her a spark of that patient, yearning tenderness which
is maternal love.</p>

<p>'Here, my child,' she said gently, 'eat and drink, and forget
the horrible things you have passed through to-day.' Wilhelmine
slipped an arm round the old woman's neck, and kissed
her as she had not done for many a long day, perhaps never
since she had been a little child. For a moment she leaned
her head against her mother's shoulder, and then taking the
food she began to eat. Frau von Gr&auml;venitz stuck the rush-light
up between a book which was lying on the table and the
edge of the plate, then shutting the window she went out,
closing and re-locking the door behind her.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the following morning Wilhelmine woke early, and she
was dressed when her mother came to the door and bade her
descend and help with the housework. All traces of the
unwonted tenderness in the old woman's face had vanished.
She had, apparently, forgotten the circumstances of the
previous day, or at any rate she made no allusion thereto,
though her daughter fancied she watched her narrowly. When
the morning's work was ended Wilhelmine returned to her
chamber to dress for the church service. She was brushing
her hair, when she heard a knock at the house door, followed
by Frau von Gr&auml;venitz's shrill tones as she conversed in the
corridor with some person. Then she heard her mother mounting
the stairs and calling 'Wilhelmine!' in flustered tones.
The girl hastened to the door of her room and stood on the
landing waiting to hear the cause of her mother's summons.</p>

<p>'Your precious Monsieur Gabriel has gone off to Schwerin,
it seems,' she said, eyeing Wilhelmine sharply. 'He has sent
a message, saying that he prays you take his place at the organ
this morning. He says he has urgent business at Schwerin,
though what it can be I am sure I do not know! However, I
suppose you will play the organ this morning, and I hope you
will make your Monsieur Gabriel pay you in good silver coin
for your trouble.' Wilhelmine's lip curled contemptuously.
'We have never paid him a groschen for teaching me to play
this same organ, mother,' she said. 'Of course I shall play this
morning, but I shall persuade Anna to come to the organ-loft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
with me,' she added, as a vision flashed across her of Pastor
M&uuml;ller, and a possible pursuit down the dark winding stair-way
after the congregation had left the church. She dressed
quickly, and wrapping her cloak round her went out into the
crisp frosty morning air to fetch Anna. When she came to
the dreary house in the Stiftstrasse where the deformed girl
lived, she was annoyed to find that her friend had already
started for church. It was Anna's habit to go to the cathedral
before the appointed hour for the church service. She loved to
sit in the dim aisle, watching the sunlight creeping through
the ancient stained glass windows, while she waited for the
first tone of the organ.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine considered for a moment. It was ridiculous to
fear M&uuml;ller; he would not dare to molest her in the precincts
of the church; yet she hated to pass the sacristy door alone,
for he could follow her, unseen from the rest of the building.
She threw back her head with a defiant movement: was she
becoming fearful, timid? Was this a frame of mind in
which to face the adventurous life at a court? She turned
away impatiently, and went swiftly down the Stiftstrasse to
the market-place. The Rathaus clock rang out, and Wilhelmine
realised that there was no time to be lost if she were
to play the voluntary to the sound of which the worshippers
were accustomed to take their places. She hastened across
the market-place, down the Klosterstrasse and through the
graveyard, where the old stone slabs on the graves were,
for the most part, hidden beneath the frost-bound snow
which glittered in the sun, though here and there an upright
tombstone showed like a discoloured, jagged tooth in the midst
of a white pall. She hurried on and entered the side door
near the sacristy. As she lifted the latch of the entrance to
the dark stair leading up to the organ-loft she heard a movement
behind her, and, turning, she saw M&uuml;ller's face peer at
her from the sacristy. She paid no heed, and springing quickly
up the steps gained the small platform, where the happiest
hours of her life had been spent with the old musician. She
peered down into the well-like space beneath the organ, where
the bellows-blower laboured, pumping in the air for the pipes.
He was at his post patiently waiting for the signal to com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>mence
his work. Wilhelmine signed to him to begin, and
having assured herself that all was in order, she glanced at the
sheets of manuscript music. She found that Monsieur Gabriel
had appointed hymns and canticles for the day, and she noticed
that he had chosen the easiest and simplest, for though her
skill almost equalled his own, he had evidently wished to
spare her difficulty and trouble. She seated herself upon the
high bench before the organ, arranging her skirts so that they
should not balk her pedalling. At first she played softly&mdash;a
wailing melody of her own devising; then, as though she
gathered strength and assurance in her music, the chords
boomed out, rich and deep, rolling down the church like the
relentless waves of some elementary force. She played on and
on, not hearing through the music the sound of the shuffling
feet of the entering worshippers. It was with a feeling of
alarm that she became aware of rows of honest burghers seated
stolidly in their accustomed places. Pastor M&uuml;ller was kneeling
in the pulpit waiting for the music to cease ere he began
the preliminary prayer. She softened the chords, till they
faded and ceased entirely, then taking up a book of canticles,
she studied the melodies and read their words, for she felt she
could not listen to M&uuml;ller's rasping voice exhorting his flock
to holiness and purity of living.</p>

<p>The harsh tones fell unheeded on her ear for some time.
A sudden cessation thereof roused her to attention, and she
craned her neck over the side of the panelled wainscot which
ran round the organ-loft. She saw the congregation attentively
waiting for the pastor to give out the text of his sermon.
M&uuml;ller stood in the pulpit; an open Bible lay on the ledge
beneath one of his strong, coarse hands; the other hand grasped
the pulpit edge, and Wilhelmine could see his knuckles whitening
with the force of his grip. His face was ashy, and the
deep-set eyes moved incessantly; he was evidently in a state of
that violent excitement which sometimes seized him when he
preached, and which gave him a fervid emotional eloquence.</p>

<p>'For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
flower of grass. The grass withereth and the flower thereof
falleth away. But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.
And this is the word which by the Gospel is preached unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
you.' He read his text in a husky, raucous voice, and through
the assemblage passed a wave of astonishment. This was
surely no verse for a Sunday before Christmas; it was more
fitted for a Lenten discourse! But Pastor M&uuml;ller's sermons
were the only theatrical performances given at G&uuml;strow, and
the citizens revelled in the often startlingly emotional character
of his exhortations; so that day they settled down as
usual to listen to his sermon with pleasurable curiosity.</p>

<p>'Brethren,' he began, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins>O miserable sinners, who lightly
look towards the season of Christ's birth as a time of rejoicing
and merry-making, forgetting the load of iniquity
which weighs you down&mdash;I call to you to pause! Tremble,
ye righteous! Quake in fearful terror, ye wrong-doers!
All joy is evil, and all things of the flesh accursed. Mourn,
ye women! Cry out and weep, ye little children! for by
lust ye were begot. Yea, sin walks abroad, and corruption
liveth in the hearts of men. Boast not thyself of to-morrow,
for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. Repent,
I command you, and scourge yourselves, for though it is
true that the Lord Christ came into the world to save sinners,
still the security you have made unto yourselves is a
vain thing. Without repentance you cannot share in the
benefit of the birth of Christ. Prepare for Christmas by
much searching of heart and renunciation of the joys of the
flesh, not by seeking fresh pleasures and carousing. For truly
the grass withereth and the flower thereof passeth away!'
He stood tense, one arm outstretched; he was moved by his
own incoherent eloquence. The congregation listened spellbound;
indeed, the man was an orator, and the very
unexpectedness of his strange violence held his listeners
enthralled. After a pause, during which the silence became
nearly intolerable, he continued his oration. His language
had a Biblical flavour, and the passion of his utterance seemed
like holy inspiration. Wilhelmine listened unmoved; she
knew that the man laboured under an excitement of being,
which had little or nothing to do with religious sincerity. It
was merely his physical fury, dammed back from a more
natural channel, which had caused this exaltation of mind.
She watched him with a mocking smile as he poured forth
a torrent of vehement words&mdash;denunciations of all things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
joyful, exhortations to repentance, and thunders of prospective
vengeance on sin. Even to her the sermon seemed a masterpiece
of eloquence, and the artistic feeling in her rejoiced in
the vigorous phrases and fervid declamation, though her
whole being revolted against the hypocrite and fanatic who
spoke, and she despised the crude bigotry of the actual matter
of the peroration.</p>

<p>His words came ever faster and in ever growing violence,
till with consummate skill he made another sudden pause;
then, sinking his voice to a tone of grave warning, he ejaculated
solemnly: 'O my brethren, men of the reformed faith,
hearken unto me! Here, before the Face of God Almighty, I
denounce the hellish instigators of all this abominable lust,
the frail instruments of temptations&mdash;Women! These are the
scourges of the world! accursed by reason of their vanity! condemned
everlastingly by reason of their carnal desire and of
their perpetual contamination of the pure heart of man!'</p>

<p>This was more than Wilhelmine could tolerate coming
from the lips of the wretch who, but a few hours before,
had proved himself to be a very beast. She would hear no
more of his insolent diatribes! She gave the sign to the
bellows-blower to commence his labours, and as she heard
M&uuml;ller's voice again rising in a burst of wild denunciation,
she crashed both hands on the keys of the organ, drowning
the preacher's words in a flood of magnificent sound. In a
triumph song of the fullness of Earth's beauty and glory the
giant chords rang out, and Wilhelmine laughed aloud under
cover of the music. This was her answer to the hollowness
of the hypocrite's denunciation of life and happiness; this
was her confession of faith in the joy of living, and this was
her revenge upon the man who had humiliated her. She
remembered, however, that the congregation must be propitiated
for the interruption, and sliding her strong fingers
from note to note on the organ she modulated her triumphant
rhapsody into the simple, restful C Major; then she played
the first bar of the canticle which Monsieur Gabriel had given
out to the singers; who, though sitting among the congregation
during the services, were still a very compact and united choir
carefully trained by him, for the most part, from childhood.
As she expected, they answered immediately to the organ's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
command, and a hundred young voices sang Luther's grand old
hymn&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p>On the following afternoon Wilhelmine was sitting disconsolately
in her attic. The book she was reading had fallen
from her hands, and her eyes rested on the ugly blue walls of
her room. She reviewed in her mind the events of the previous
day; the scene in the church, and her subsequent departure
therefrom, which she had managed so deftly that, though
M&uuml;ller was in the graveyard when she came out, she had
evaded him, and joining Anna, who was waiting for her near
the porch, she had succeeded in passing the pastor without
staying to hear what he evidently wished to say. Frau von
Gr&auml;venitz chid her sharply for interrupting the sermon, but
she was silenced by Wilhelmine's angry retort and reminder
of M&uuml;ller's misdeeds. The Sunday afternoon and evening had
passed without any unwonted occurrence. Wilhelmine was
tortured by the fact that she had not told her mother of
Friedrich's letter; she had not recovered it from M&uuml;ller, though
twice she had sent the servant-maid to demand its restitution.</p>

<p>She intended to reveal the whole story to her mother, when
Monsieur Gabriel returned with the promised money; for she
guessed that the object of his journey to Schwerin was the
procuring of the sum. The light was failing rapidly, and
Wilhelmine felt intensely dreary and sad. She turned over
the leaves of the book which lay on her lap; it was a volume
lent her by Monsieur Gabriel, a book written by Blaise Pascal.
Her eye was caught by a sentence, and she read the wise
words of the great thinker: 'Love hath its reasons which
reason knoweth not.' Again her attention wandered from the
page; her thoughts were busy with the possibilities of her
destiny. With bitterness she realised that, for her, Love must
be either a renunciation of ambition, a life passed with some
simple countryman, or else a career, a profession, an abnegation
of quiet days. Which should she strive for? 'What does it
avail a man though he gain the whole world and lose his own
soul?' The words came back to her; but no, she was not made
for peaceful days, she would weary of them inevitably.</p>

<p>She heard a knock on the house door and, shaking off her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
unusual depression, she hurried downstairs. Monsieur Gabriel
stood in the corridor explaining in his scholarly foreign German
to the servant-maid, that it was absolutely necessary for him to
see Fr&auml;ulein von Gr&auml;venitz, even if madame her mother could
not receive him, as he had a matter of importance to communicate.
He smiled when he saw Wilhelmine&mdash;that good
smile of his, which was at once so kind, so bright, and yet so
unutterably sad.</p>

<p>'Ah! dear child!' he said, in French, 'I bring you good news.
I have procured the money.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine went quickly up to him, and taking his hand
in both of hers, she drew him into the prim little dwelling-room
where Frau von Gr&auml;venitz received her rare guests.
'How can I ever thank you?' she said as she closed the door.</p>

<p>'By thinking of me when you are far away,' he answered,
'and sometimes by sending me a letter to lighten my gloom.'</p>

<p>'Yes!' she said eagerly; 'but tell me how you procured this
great sum?'</p>

<p>'I had a few old trinkets,' he answered, 'which I had carried
with me from France. They were hidden in my travelling
chest, and I had not even looked at them these many years.
They reminded me of another life, a life which has nothing to
do with the old schoolmaster of G&uuml;strow,' he added with a
sigh. He laid a packet on the table, cut the string with his
knife, and began to undo four long rolls within, disclosing
the bright edges of twenty-five golden gulden in each roll.
'Twenty-five, fifty, seventy-five, a hundred,' he counted out.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine looked curiously at the coins; she had seldom
seen gold pieces before, and never in a large quantity. She laid
her hand on one of the rouleaux. 'Gold is power, they say,'
she murmured.</p>

<p>'The getting of gold is pain,' the old man answered, and he
took her hand in his, drawing hers away from the golden heap.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened silently, and Frau von
Gr&auml;venitz stood on the threshold. She looked from one to
the other, she saw the money on the table, and Wilhelmine's
sparkling eyes and flushed cheeks. Monsieur Gabriel's face
she could not see, for it was turned away from her towards
Wilhelmine; but she could see that he held her hand in his,
and all her suspicions re-awoke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
'What is this?' she said: 'Monsieur Gabriel, why are you
bringing money to my daughter?' Both Wilhelmine and her
friend started. 'For her journey to Stuttgart, madame,' he
answered. 'Her journey?' said the old woman, 'what journey?
What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Ah! Mademoiselle Wilhelmine has perhaps not had time
to communicate her plans to you, madame,' he replied courteously.
'She told me of her brother's letter, and as I thought
that madame had perhaps not got so large a sum of money at
her disposal at the moment, I have ventured to make a little
gift to my favourite pupil, to enable her to accept her brother's
proposition. Believe me, madame, I esteem it an honour to
be of service to one whose wonderful gift of music has made
my poor life so much happier than it could have been otherwise.'</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine, what is the meaning of this?' cried Frau von
Gr&auml;venitz in her sharpest tones. 'You have received a letter
from my son, of which you have not informed me! You plan
things with a stranger, and I am told nothing! You receive
money from a man&mdash;what for, I should like to know? I dare
not say what terrible thoughts all this awakens in me. Give
me your brother's letter immediately!' Her voice had risen
higher and higher, till she almost screamed the last words.</p>

<p>'I cannot give you the letter, mother,' Wilhelmine returned
quietly, 'I have lost it.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur Gabriel,' said Frau von Gr&auml;venitz, 'perhaps you
have got it? I command you to hand it over to me.'</p>

<p>'Madame, I am astounded! Indeed, I have not got the
letter, though Mademoiselle Wilhelmine showed it to me on
Saturday morning.'</p>

<p>'Yes! Saturday morning!' Frau von Gr&auml;venitz retorted with
a sneer. 'Of a truth, you and my daughter have reason to remember
that day. You are a corrupter of youth, and an evil
man, Mr. Schoolmaster, and a purloiner of letters as well.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Gabriel looked from the irate lady to her daughter,
in consternation and bewilderment. 'I fear, madame, that I
do not understand you,' he said gently; 'you labour under a
misapprehension. I have never had the letter in my possession.
As for your other accusation, I think you are led away by your
anger. Indeed, I do not know the meaning of your words,
madame.' His calmness only served to madden Frau von<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
Gr&auml;venitz further. She turned away from him, and seizing
Wilhelmine roughly by the shoulder, she hissed in her ear:
'Give me the letter, you wanton!' Wilhelmine started
violently, and Monsieur Gabriel made a step forward, as
though to defend her; his face flushed deeply, and he said in a
steady voice: 'Madame de Gr&auml;venitz, such an accusation, even
from a mother's lips, is a thing to which no woman has the
right to submit.' But Frau von Gr&auml;venitz was beyond hearing;
her features were distorted by rage, and her mouth twitched
convulsively. 'How dare you address me?' she screamed;
'you are my daughter's seducer&mdash;go&mdash;leave my house, and take
the wages of my daughter's sin with you!' She came up to the
table, and with a sweep of her arm scattered the gold to right
and left.</p>

<p>'Mother!' cried Wilhelmine, 'you are mad!'</p>

<p>'Madame,' said Monsieur Gabriel, 'I can but obey your
command to depart,' and with a profoundly respectful bow to
Wilhelmine, he quitted the apartment with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>Frau von Gr&auml;venitz continued her fierce monologue for some
time, without interruption. Wilhelmine stood watching her,
till an involuntary breathless pause in her mother's torrent of
words gave her the opportunity of speech. 'You have always
been unjust to me, mother,' she said, in a hard, cold voice; 'and
to-day you have insulted me, in the presence of one you called
a stranger. Yes; Friedrich wrote, proposing that I should go
and seek a more prosperous life in Wirtemberg. Yes; I told
Monsieur Gabriel. Yes; he said he would give me the money
for my journey. I warn you that I shall go, and it will be of
no avail if you attempt to hinder me.'</p>

<p>'You will not go,' said Frau von Gr&auml;venitz harshly. 'The
money you have earned by your dishonour I shall give to the
poor.'</p>

<p>'It is not yours to give,' answered Wilhelmine coldly.</p>

<p>'We shall see,' replied her mother grimly, and commenced
an undignified scramble beneath the table, as she gathered up
the scattered gold pieces. When she had found all, and carefully
counted it out, she placed it in an oaken cupboard,
double locked the door thereof, and placed the key in her
pocket, Wilhelmine watching her the while.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
The evening meal was eaten in utter silence. Frau von
Gr&auml;venitz superintended the washing up of the plates, knives,
and forks; then going to the house door she fastened it securely,
taking the key with her. While the old woman was occupied
at the house door, Wilhelmine slipped up the stairs, with the
noiseless tread of a cat, and abstracted the key from her
mother's bedroom door, then passing to her attic she undressed,
and, wrapping her bedgown round her, lay down on her bed.
The stolen key she tied firmly in a knot of her hair, close to
her head, well hidden by her thick curls. Having accomplished
this, she feigned sleep. As she expected, her mother soon
discovered the absence of the key, and after a fruitless search
in her own room she stormed into Wilhelmine's attic, and
accused her of having removed it. The girl looked at her
from sleepy eyes, and denied all knowledge of the missing
article. Frau von Gr&auml;venitz searched the room, and then
bidding her daughter rise, she felt beneath her mattress and
pillow. Then she ran her hand over her daughter's body, but
she never thought of examining the waves of hair, under which
the key was safely hidden. At length, she was satisfied that
it was not in her daughter's keeping, and she retired to bed
grumbling.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine listened attentively for some half-hour, then
gently pushed aside the covering and noiselessly unlatched
the door. She crept towards her mother's door and listened.
For some time she heard nothing, but at length her patience
was rewarded by the sound of a long, even breath, and she
knew her mother was asleep. Wilhelmine returned to her
apartment. Slowly and silently she resumed her clothes.
Fortunately there was a moon, and the room was flooded with
pale light. She did not put on boots, skirt, or cloak, but
deposited these in a heap on the corridor floor. Then she
approached her mother's door, and listened once more; the
regular breaths were quite audible now. Softly she lifted the
latch, and passed into the room. The moon was hidden for a
moment, and the room was in utter darkness. She crouched,
and carefully drew the door to behind her; it creaked, and
Frau von Gr&auml;venitz moved in her sleep. Wilhelmine crouched
lower, and taking a kerchief from her breast pushed it beneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
the door, to steady it. She waited motionless till her mother's
breathing told her that she was really asleep, and then, with
noiseless tread, she approached the sleeper. The clouds shifted
and the moon shone in, showing Frau von Gr&auml;venitz's face
livid and deathlike in the luminous moonshine. The girl
shuddered; it was like robbing a corpse, she thought. But her
hesitation was momentary; she pushed her flexible hand beneath
her mother's pillow, and her fingers closed on the cold iron of
a key. She drew it out, but she felt rather than saw that it was
not the one wanted. She was stretching out her hand to seek
for the other key, when the sleeper stirred uneasily, murmuring
some incomprehensible word, and Wilhelmine cowered
down once more. The old woman turned round in bed, so
that she faced the crouching girl; her face was now in
shadow, and Wilhelmine could not see whether the eyes were
open or shut. She waited for what seemed hours in that
hunched-up position. After some time, the even breathing
recommenced, and Wilhelmine ventured to kneel up beside
the bed, but now a fresh difficulty confronted her: to reach
the other key, provided it lay beneath the pillow, she must
pass her hand under that portion of the pillow upon which
Frau von Gr&auml;venitz's head rested. She wriggled her hand in,
and the point of her fingers touched the key; but it was too
far away for her to grasp it, and her efforts only pushed it
further. She withdrew her hand, and waited till the clouds
floated over the moon. When the welcome darkness came, she
bent over her mother, and lifting the further edge of the pillow
quickly found the key. Then she crept noiselessly to the
threshold, took her kerchief, and shut the door silently. Safe
in the corridor, she caught up her bundle of garments and
groped her way down the stairs, which creaked under her, but
she heard no movement in the house, though she listened
attentively at the foot of the stairs. Swiftly she gained the
dwelling-room, fitted the key into the oaken press, unlocked
it, and took out the rolls of gold. In another moment she
stood in the snow-covered street, the money for her journey
safe in her hand.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz had taken the first step of an
extraordinary career.</p>

<h3>THE JOURNEY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'When the meadow glows, and the orchard snows,</p>

<p class="ihalf">When fancies break, and the senses wake,</p>
<p class="i2">O, life's a dream worth dreaming.'</p>

</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">A heavy</span>, leaden sky hung over the small town of Cannstatt,
and the people looked with foreboding at the lowering black
clouds, and the weather-wise foretold a furious thunder-storm.
For many weeks the heavens had smiled as though summer
had come, though in truth the spring was but just begun, and
May counted but few days. The trees of the forest were
donning their leafy garments, the orchards were white and
pink with apple, pear, and cherry blossom, and the young
grass stood tall and feathery in an unusually early maturity.
Of course the peasants grumbled, as peasants always do; they
complained of the heat and shook their heads over a belated
frost, which they declared must come to chastise the forwardness
of the growing things; they demanded rain from the
smiling blue heavens, and contemplated gloomily the tender,
green shoots of the vines. But when, in answer to their
prayers for rain, the sky lowered and the sun vanished, they
grumbled again and spoke of the hailstones, which would
come to dash the blossoms of the fruit-trees and break the
young vines. All day the thunder had menaced but had not
fulfilled the threat, and when evening fell the air was still
heavily oppressive. A rumbling sound caused the people to
run to their lattice windows and look up at the sky, wondering
if the storm had come at last; but it was only the echo of
carriage-wheels rolling through the medi&aelig;val archway, which
led to the fields beyond the town. The diligence drew up
ponderously at the door of the Hotel Zur Post, and the driver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
descended equally ponderously, demanding loudly a drink of
good Wirtemberg wine. Meanwhile an imperious voice from
the conveyance could be heard inquiring whether they had
arrived at Stuttgart, and if not, where they were. No one
answering this query, a hand was visible thrust out of the
clumsy diligence, in an attempt to unfasten the catch which
held the door firm. A bystander came forward and undid
the door, and a tall woman stood on the step of the coach
looking around her. As she put her foot to the ground in
her further descent, a brilliant flash of forked lightning,
followed immediately by a tremendous detonation of thunder,
announced the storm's advent.</p>

<p>Rain began to fall in torrents, as though the clouds were rent
asunder and poured long pent-up anger upon the world. The
lady hastened to the porch of the Gasthof to seek shelter, and
the driver of the coach led his tired horses under cover of a
shed in the courtyard. The chief room of the inn was a
cheerless apartment, long and dark, with narrow, rough
wooden tables fitted round the walls. A strong, stale smell
greeted the nose disagreeably. One or two peasants sat at the
far end of one of the tables; they stared rudely as the lady
entered, and whispered remarks about her, grinning broadly
the while. She glanced haughtily at them and called to the
innkeeper, who had followed her from the courtyard, desiring
him to bring her food and wine. He went slowly to a painted
wooden cupboard, which stood against the wall at the back of
the room, and returned with a lump of coarse bread and some
raw ham which he set down on the dirty table. Taking an
earthenware jug from before the group of peasants, he brought
it to add to the lady's unappetising meal. 'Good wine last
year here,' he said. 'Then, at least, something is good, Herr
Wirth, in your inn!' she answered; 'but tell me,' she continued,
with a smile which almost charmed even the boorish
innkeeper, 'how far is it to Stuttgart, and what is the name of
this village?' 'Village? Lady, it is a township, and much
older than Stuttgart! It is Cannstatt, where the Romans
have left a camp, but Stuttgart is the finer because the Duke's
court is there. You have travelled far?' he added, his curiosity
getting the better of the unfriendly distrust with which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
the Wirtemberger regards all strangers. 'From the far north,'
she answered shortly. 'You have never been in our country
before?' he asked; 'well, you have an ill-omened day for your
arrival; the storm greeted you!' The lady started. 'Thank
you for reminding me,' she said, 'I dislike ill omens.' The
man grinned: it delighted his honest soul to have succeeded
in annoying a foreigner. 'You will reach Stuttgart to-night,
for it is only half a league from here. Is Stuttgart your
destination?' he asked. 'Perhaps,' she answered, and turned
away; the man's curiosity was, evidently, little to her taste.
However, another thought seemed to come to her, for she
turned again towards him, and, with a smile of infinite
sweetness, began to question him on the country, the people,
and the court. At first he answered shortly enough, but the
lady fixed her eyes upon him. Gradually he felt (he told the
tale often in later days) a sort of dream-feeling creep over
him, and he replied to all her questions fully, telling her
everything he knew of the country gossip: how the Duke was
heartily weary of his wife, Duchess Johanna Elizabetha; how
she was eternally jealous of him; of how a Frau von Geyling
held the Duke enthralled; that the Erbprinz was a sickly
child of nine years old, who men said could not be long for
this world. He told her of the people's hatred of a Herr von
Stafforth, a foreigner, who had become very mighty in
Stuttgart; in fact he gossiped freely, and perhaps, in his
half-hour's talk, let her discover more of the people's thoughts,
and the dangerously discontented state of the country, than
was known to the ministers of Wirtemberg. At length the
lady rose and requested him to see if the storm had sufficiently
abated for the coach to continue its journey. The man went
out rubbing his eyes; he felt as if he had been half asleep.</p>

<p>The storm was over, and only the rain fell quietly as the
coach rumbled out of Cannstatt and across the bridge over the
Neckar. The lady leaned back against the wooden side of the
diligence and closed her eyes. She reflected that she must be
near Stuttgart, and she wondered what her destiny would be
in the town which she was nearing in the darkness. Gradually
the monotonous creaking and the jolting of the heavy vehicle
made her drowsy, also she felt the warmth of the potent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
Wirtemberg wine glow through her tired limbs. The coach
passed through the outskirts of Stuttgart, but Wilhelmine
von Gr&auml;venitz, for it was she, slept and did not see the
outlying houses of that town, where Fate willed she should
play so important a part.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine had tarried in Berlin with her sister, Frau
Sittmann, and the days of her visit had lengthened to weeks
ere she had resumed her journey southwards, for she had been
sick unto death with smallpox. When she recovered she had
almost found it in her heart to return to G&uuml;strow and hide
her ravaged beauty; but in reality the fell disease had been
very merciful, and though Wilhelmine's skin was slightly pock-marked,
the bloom and colour of her magnificent health and
forceful youth rendered the marks inoffensive. Thus, though
long delayed, she had at last continued her adventurous quest.</p>

<p>The coach lumbered on, and Wilhelmine woke with a start
as a more than usually violent jolt flung her against the door.
She peered out into the darkness but could see nothing, for
the night was absolutely starless. The road was so steep that
at moments the heavy carriage threatened to run backwards
down the hill, in spite of the straining of the wretched horses
that struggled onwards, slipping and floundering on the dripping
road. At the top of the hill the driver pulled up to breathe
the poor beasts; he came round to the back of the coach and
called to Wilhelmine that if she leaned out of the window she
would see the lights of the town of Stuttgart beneath her in
the valley. She looked out, and far down she saw lights
glittering through the night. There were only a few visible,
for the windows of most of the houses were probably curtained
to shut out the wet night. Wilhelmine drew back into the
diligence with a sense of disappointment. She had dreamed
of a splendid city, and this seemed like a village.</p>

<p>She slept again, and it was the morning sun shining on her
face which roused her. She looked out of the window once more,
and this time a smiling landscape met her eye. The route ran
between green fields, and on each side of the road were huge,
gnarled apple and pear trees, which spring had crowned with
a glory of snowy blossom. In the near distance rose rounded,
fir-clad hills, here and there the sombre colour broken by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
the delicate verdure of young beech leaves. A delicious
morning air kissed Wilhelmine's cheeks and lips as she leaned
out of the window, wafting to her the faint, sweet breath of
the fruit blossom mixed with the smell of the wet fields and
woods. 'What a glorious country!' she said aloud, and she
called to the driver to stop and let her rest her aching limbs
in a few minutes' walk. The man opened the door and bade
her 'Gr&uuml;ss Gott, Fr&auml;ulein,' and even the surly tone in which
the words were uttered could not spoil the beauty of the
friendly South German greeting. 'All the fields and the
woods say "Gr&uuml;ss Gott" to-day, I think!' she returned. The
heavy Swabian peasant stared at her. 'What ridiculous
things these foreigners say!' was written so clearly in his
face, that Wilhelmine laughed outright.</p>

<p>'Where do we change horses next?' she queried. He
told her at T&uuml;bingen in an hour's time, and that they would
reach her destination, Rottenburg, about twelve of the clock.
When they rattled in to the old town of T&uuml;bingen the driver
informed her that they made an hour's halt there. 'Unless
indeed,' he added, 'you choose to travel to Rottenburg by
special post-chaise, at a cost of twelve gulden.'</p>

<p>But Wilhelmine had few gulden to spare, and she
decided to wander about the town until the ordinary diligence
started for Rottenburg. She climbed the steep road to the
ancient castle. The moat was filled with flowers and shrubs.
It surprised her to see this peaceful garrison of the fortifications
of a stronghold so soon after the invasion of Wirtemberg
by the troops of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> She questioned a peasant
who was loitering near the drawbridge. He laughed at her,
and endeavoured to be witty at her expense, after the agreeable
manner of the Swabian, who thinks himself entitled
to poke clumsy fun at any questioner. He condescended,
however, to inform her that in fertile Wirtemberg flowers and
all growing things find a home each spring in any and every
nook and cranny, careless that their forbears of a twelvemonth
have been uprooted.</p>

<p>'A beautiful land,' she murmured, 'peopled by boors!'
She turned away from her discourteous informant and contemplated
the grey walls of the castle, so strong and grim, yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
dressed with the gracious flowers of a lavish spring. As she
stood admiring the wonderful Renaissance gateway, one side
of the huge door was pushed open and a young man in
student's dress emerged. His face, though sickly and
emaciated, interested her by reason of its vivid intelligence
and a certain mocking look of eye and lip.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Wilhelmine, as the youth approached over the
drawbridge, 'could I see the castle, do you think? I am a
stranger and have an hour to pass in T&uuml;bingen, and I would
fain wile away the time of my stay here.' He told her she
was at liberty to wander through the courtyard; he need but
request the doorkeeper to admit her. 'I am a student in
this university,' he explained, 'for though this castle is in
reality a royal residence, the students occupy one side of the
quadrangle; and, in truth, his Highness Eberhard Ludwig
seldom visits his fortress of T&uuml;bingen.' She thanked him for
his courtesy and would have passed on alone, but the student
followed her through the peaceful courtyard, proudly pointing
out to her the fine workmanship of the fountain. Then he
made her peep through the windows of the library, which
filled one side of the building. There she saw black-robed
students poring over the books. 'Melanchthon lectured there,'
he said; 'Erasmus was here, and the learned Dr. Faustus of
Maulbronn came and studied here, so legend says.'</p>

<p>He took her up the moss-grown steps at the end of the
courtyard, and out on to the rampart. A view of infinite
beauty lay before her: a vast expanse of green fields through
which the river Neckar flows gently, a smiling valley
glittering in the morning sunshine and radiant with fruit
blossom. In the middle distance were fir-clad hills, while
behind them rose blue and misty mountains. The student
pointed southwards. 'Over there is the ruined castle of
Hohenzollern. If you have good eyes you can catch the sun
glinting upon one of the few remaining towers. It is the
ancient home of that strong race which rules Prussia. This
Southern Germany is the birthland of great races. Hohenstauffen
is another mountain in this range; but you cannot
see it from here, it is too far.' The student spoke dreamily,
as though the changing destinies of master races lay before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
him in a vision. Wilhelmine leant against the stone balustrade
and gazed at the beautiful country. She was interested
in the scholar's talk, and she waited, hoping he would continue;
but as he did not speak, she asked him whether the
castle of the Hohenstauffens still existed. He told her that
not one stone remained upon another. 'Vanished like the
proud race which was called by its name, only a memory now
to the few who love the past!' he said. 'All things vanish,
Fr&auml;ulein,' he continued, 'the good, the great, the wrong, the
glory, and the tears; the wise man must carve his name on
the <i>lives</i> of those around him if he would benefit by power.
The noble deed carved on stone raised to do us honour after
death is almost mockery. Personal power during our lives,
riches, enjoyment, all that dominion over others gives&mdash;&mdash;'
He paused and laughed harshly.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine looked at him. 'What power do you seek,
Mr. Student?' she asked curiously.</p>

<p>'For myself, little! I wish for a sufficiency of money to
be able to pursue my studies, that is all. I am a theologian,
and shall be a pastor in a few months' time, and the occupation
with the uninteresting peasant souls of a country parish is
little to my taste.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine observed him narrowly. This man might prove
useful, she reflected, if she should desire a service, and if she
were in a position to pay for it. 'Tell me your name,' she
said. He told her&mdash;Otto Pfahler, and in return he begged
her to tell him who she was; but she evaded the question,
and asked him concerning the history of T&uuml;bingen. There
is no being on earth more easy to manage than an historical
enthusiast who has seldom the opportunity of expatiating on
the legends which he loves; you have but to turn his mind
to the past, he will wander off therein, and you need not even
listen, provided you have the wit to nod in an interested way
at intervals. Pfahler talked on as he accompanied Wilhelmine
across the courtyard, and she was able to dismiss him
with a bow and a word of thanks for his historic anecdotes,
without divulging her identity.</p>

<p>When Wilhelmine regained the diligence, she found the
horses already harnessed and the driver climbing upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
box. She took her place in the clumsy vehicle and recommenced
her journey.</p>

<p>The road from T&uuml;bingen to Rottenburg winds through the
valley of the Neckar for some ten miles. It is the usual
South German high-road, bordered by large fruit-trees; but
to Wilhelmine, coming from the bleak northern winter, it
seemed as though she had been set down in Fairyland. The
white and pink blossoms of the fruit-trees, the strong high
grass whitened by the luxuriant growth of the cow-parsley,
touched here and there with the gold of the giant kingcups,
and, as though the Master's palette had been robbed of all its
colours to complete this radiant spring picture, the very earth
of the vineyards below the fresh green of the vine sprouts
shone with the rich red brown of the Wirtemberg soil, which
is one more opulent charm added to the beauty of an
indescribably lovely spring country. Rottenburg lies in the
centre of this valley; the Neckar flows placidly half way
round the small town. The diligence rolled over a medi&aelig;val
bridge which spans the river, and Wilhelmine found herself
at the end of her tedious, rattling journey. She stepped out
of the coach and looked about her, expecting to see her
brother.</p>

<p>The narrow street was empty, save for several black-gowned
figures moving slowly towards an enormous building, which
flanked one side of a square or market-place, at the end
of the street.</p>

<p>As she stood a moment hesitating, she heard herself addressed
from the door of the inn, before which the diligence
had halted. Turning she saw a most suave personage bowing
and smiling, and imploring her to enter the hostelry.
Wilhelmine looked with interest at the man, evidently the
innkeeper, yet of so clerical an appearance that she thought
he must be a particularly prosperous priest. She entered the
inn, and was ordering herself some slight refreshment from
her obsequious host when bells from some neighbouring
church rang out. The innkeeper crossed his brow and breast
with the third finger of his right hand, while with his left
hand he piously hid his eyes. He recited some prayers in
a mumbling undertone, then crossing himself once more, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
turned with an oily smile to Wilhelmine. 'The Angelus,'
he said; 'evidently Madame is not of the Faith. Here in
Rottenburg we are all members of the true Church. We
have had the privilege of having a Jesuit college here these
many years.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine made some appropriate answer, and noted for
the first time in her personal experience the truth of a remark
of Monsieur Gabriel's, that one of the strengths of the Catholic
Church is the semi-clericalising of the laymen who live in or
near any religious centre. It flatters the uneducated to feel
themselves akin to their spiritual dictators, and it gives them
a spurious refinement. Undoubtedly, the host of the R&ouml;mischer
Kaiser was an excellent specimen of this class.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine, having partaken of her breakfast, was setting
out to walk towards the Neuhaus, where her brother had
directed her to appear, when she saw Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz
coming down the street. He greeted his sister hastily, and
explained that the diligence had arrived before the usual
hour. He apologised for not having been at the inn to
welcome his sister on her arrival, but it struck Wilhelmine
that though her brother had gained in polish of manner since
he had become a courtier, he had lost the warmth and friendliness
which had characterised him in earlier days. She felt
chilled and saddened, and it was in silence that she walked
beside him across the fields from Rottenburg to Madame de
Ruth's house. A stout peasant followed them carrying her
scanty baggage. Friedrich talked volubly to his unresponsive
companion, and though he expressed the hope, with much
politeness, that she was not fatigued by her journey, he did
not listen to her reply, but plunged into an exact account of
his own position at court and of his poverty and difficulties.
His sister was weary, and an overpowering sense of loneliness
possessed her; she had always known her brother to be an
egoist, but a certain spontaneous, easy kindness had masked
his self-love when he was in Mecklemburg.</p>

<p>They walked over the field before the house, passed
through the tree-shaded garden, up the red-tiled garden-path
to the side door of the Neuhaus, and Friedrich
knocked loudly with the handle of his cane on the panel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
Madame de Ruth's peasant servant admitted them, and
led the way through the dark corridor to the panelled
room, where, three months earlier, it had been decided that
Wilhelmine should be summoned to Wirtemberg to help fill
her brother's purse.</p>

<p>The sunshine streamed down on the garden without, but
the room was chilly, and Wilhelmine shivered a little as she
stood waiting for her unknown hostess to appear. It could
not be said that Wilhelmine was a timid woman, yet hers
was one of those natures which, though ready to attempt
many things, shrink unaccountably at any touch of dreariness,
and almost dread meeting strangers. She looked at her
brother, who stood with his back turned towards the room,
gazing out at the sunlit garden. She noted his broad
shoulders, the graceful pose of the body, the straight, shapely
legs, and the slightness of hip which distinguished him from
the usual heavily-built German. There was beauty in his
lines, and yet a certain strangeness of proportion in the whole
figure which puzzled her for a moment; then she noticed the
extreme smallness of his head, and the curious absence of
development in the back of the skull, which gave him a well-bred
but foolish look. He was quite amiable, and meant
kindly towards his sister, yet he was incapable of helping in
what was for her a difficult moment; indeed, he added to her
feeling of loneliness by his loud talk and patronising air.
At length the door opened and Madame de Ruth appeared.
She came forward with hands outstretched and a smile of
welcome on her kind, ugly face, which became most genial when
she saw her guest's undoubted beauty. 'A thousand pardons
for keeping you waiting, my dear! I was not dressed, lazy
old woman that I am! And how fatigued you must be,
dear child; such a journey!&mdash;Gr&auml;venitz, have you not
offered your sister some refreshment? Good Lord! what an
idea! What? You say you have been talking? Yes, yes,
I warrant you have!' Her sharp eyes had taken in the
situation. Madame de Ruth, though she talked, as Zollern
said, 'like a book,' had the faculty of talking and observing
at the same time. People think that the talkers of the
world are so occupied with their own prattle that their eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
remain idle; whereas some of the most practised observers,
especially those of the feminine sex, have learned that it is
possible to extract more information from others by appearing
to impart much, and that a flow of speech masks the
observation to a great extent. The garrulous lady saw the
brother's pompous attitude; she had caught the tones of his
unmodulated voice before she entered, and she noticed immediately
the shadow on the girl's face and guessed what the
new arrival felt.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine responded readily to Madame de Ruth. Soon
the girl felt as though she had known her for years. After
a few minutes' conversation the two ladies left the formal
living-room, and passed up a broad wooden stair to a room on
the first floor, where Wilhelmine found her few belongings
already set down. It was a pretty room for those days,
though we should now consider it but insufficiently furnished.
Bare, brown-stained boards, a narrow wooden bedstead, a
couple of carved wooden chairs, a large carved cupboard,
and a table, on which stood a tiny washing-basin and ewer of
beautiful porcelain, completed the appointments. The hostess
rattled on cheerfully while Wilhelmine divested herself of
the cloak and hood. She realised that Madame de Ruth
intended to remain, curious to see the contents of the travelling-basket;
but this was precisely what the guest did not
desire, for she had no wish to expose the scantiness of her
wardrobe to her new friend. She sat down on one of the
wooden chairs opposite her hostess, and listened to the voluble
talk. Both women knew exactly what the other wanted, and
both were equally determined not to be beaten; also both
knew that the other knew what they each wanted. It was
one of those small feminine conflicts which take place
every day. The older woman's tongue ran on, while her
sharp eyes noted every shade and change in her guest's face.
Wilhelmine answered the many questions frankly enough,
but Madame de Ruth observed with satisfaction that she told
only such things as all the world might hear. There were no
outbursts of girlish confidences, no indiscreet questions; she
was mistress of the situation, and if she showed any shyness,
it was never either awkward or foolish, but seemed merely a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
delightful youthful attribute, an added charm. Her hostess
felt a deepening interest. This girl would be a more potent
factor in the intrigues for which they had destined her than
they had dreamed. She watched Wilhelmine as a full-grown
tigress might watch the play of a tiger cub, noting the promise
of each movement, gauging the strength of the young
animal, and calculating the fighting powers which it would
develop. At length Madame de Ruth rose, and, drawing
Wilhelmine to her, she kissed her affectionately. 'You have
a future before you, my dear,' she said, and her fine smile lit
her face. 'You have bewitched me, and you will bewitch
others of more importance. Now, dress. We dine at three
o'clock, and the Duke of Zollern will be with us.'</p>

<hr />

<p>The Duke of Zollern was seated at Madame de Ruth's
right hand; Monsieur de Stafforth, Oberhofmarshall of the
court of Wirtemberg, was at her left; Madame Friedrich
de Gr&auml;venitz sat beside the Duke to his right; beside
her was the Freiherr von Reischach, a gentleman famous
for his fine courtliness and his experience in war and love;
Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz sat next to him, and then came Wilhelmine
seated between her brother and Monsieur de Stafforth,
opposite her hostess and the Duke of Zollern. Madame de
Ruth sat with her back turned towards the light; she
knew the value of shadow to an ageing face, and always
declared that the glare hurt her eyes, though, God knows,
these were neither weak nor easily dazzled. The Duke
of Zollern, too, liked to have the light behind him. 'It
is fitting for the old to turn their backs to the sunshine,'
he had remarked as they took their places at the table, 'for,
indeed, the light of youth is behind us, shining, alas! on the
paths we have already traversed. For the young&mdash;let the
sunshine lie before them, making their youth still more fair&mdash;if
possible.' And he had bowed in his inimitable way to
Wilhelmine, who delighted in this courteous speech, though
she was perfectly aware that he and Madame de Ruth had
placed her in the full light in order to study her the better.
Of a truth, Wilhelmine looked wonderfully lovely that afternoon.
Her luxuriant hair, innocent of powder, was piled high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
on her head, and turned back from off her white brow;
the glow of perfect health was in her cheeks, and her strange
magnetic eyes were softened by shyness. She had fashioned
herself a bodice out of the feast-day kerchiefs which Mecklemburg
peasant women wear; cutting off the flowered borders,
she had joined them together and made a deep hem which
she had sewn on her dark blue linen skirt. The corsage was
cut down at the back, and the front she had cut out in a deep
V shape, showing her creamy neck and the gentle rise of her
breast. A poor garment indeed, but the kerchiefs had been
carefully collected, and were all of the same delicate pink
colour, and she had further softened the lines round the
contour of her neck by a folded white kerchief. At her
bosom she had fastened a spray of apple-blossom, and the
petals leaning against her white skin were not more delicate,
more divinely young than her breast. She looked like a
blossom herself as the sunlight touched her, and the men
round the dinner-table gazed so eagerly at her, that she knew
she must be more beautiful than the ladies of the court,
albeit their gowns were of silk.</p>

<p>No dinner could be dull if Madame de Ruth was there;
and Zollern, with his courtly grace and witty talk, was a host
in himself. Reischach was silent, but his openly admiring
looks at Wilhelmine pleased her more than the phrases of a
talkative gallant. As for Gr&auml;venitz, he talked loudly, according
to his wont, paying but little heed to the random answers
of Monsieur de Stafforth, who like Reischach was occupied
with Wilhelmine. But, unlike Reischach, Stafforth's admiration,
though not so open, had that touch of coarseness which
is so often the mark of the bourgeois' approval. Madame de
Gr&auml;venitz, it was evident, entirely disapproved of Wilhelmine.
She was a pretty, colourless devotee, and she felt her sister-in-law's
beauty and obvious fascination to be almost indecorous.
Madame de Ruth chattered as usual, though at moments she
paused to whisper a comment to Zollern, who answered in
a low voice by some subtle irony which caused the lady much
amusement. The dinner was very long, and it was with relief
that Wilhelmine saw her hostess rise from the table. 'Coffee
in the garden, mes amis! and then Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
shall sing to us. There is a clavichord in the panelled room,
and we will leave the garden door open in order to hear the
music. Come, Marie! what a gloomy face! Why must the
pious be gloomy? Lord, girl! forget your sins for once, or
you will exhaust the stock, and then there will be nothing to
repent of. Think, my dear,' she said, turning to Wilhelmine,
'your sister-in-law is a saint. O Monseigneur, you shake a
finger at me! Brook? Who talks of brooks? Ah, well, I
talk too much!&mdash;well, well!&mdash;An account on the Last Day of
my words? I pity the angel who adds up the sum! But
come, coffee! and a moment's silence, my friends!'</p>

<p>They all laughed. Madame de Ruth's vivacity was infectious;
and even Marie Gr&auml;venitz was smiling, as the party
passed through the living-room and into the garden. They
went down the red-tiled path, and, turning to the left, came to
a stone bench before which, on a square table, the servant had
placed the coffee and seven tiny porcelain cups. Madame
de Ruth busied herself preparing the coffee for her guests,
and Zollern watched her, seated near on the bench. Marie
Gr&auml;venitz walked a short distance away, her demure figure
harmonising well with the peace of the formal garden;
Gr&auml;venitz leaned against the back of the bench and looked
with complacency at the good brown coffee, which his hostess
was pouring into the little cups. Coffee was expensive, and
being regarded as a great luxury, was only dispensed in very
small quantities. Reischach and Monsieur de Stafforth were
dallying with Wilhelmine, who stood listening to their compliments
with a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle,' Stafforth was saying, 'the court will rejoice
in your presence. We crave for youth&mdash;more still, we crave
for beauty! His Highness will welcome you, though, I trow,
Madame the Duchess may not prove so gracious! But when
will you come to Stuttgart? It will be my privilege to
herald your arrival.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur, I am guided by my brother in these matters.
He is my protector, as is fitting,' she said, a trifle haughtily.
Monsieur de Stafforth's obsequious, yet patronising tone displeased
her, and somehow she desired him to know that her
brother stood at her side in the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
'Mademoiselle is right,' said Reischach shortly, 'these
things will be arranged. The coffee waits you, Monsieur;
it would be a pity should your portion get cold.' He spoke
lightly, but Wilhelmine recognised the man of breeding in
the covert hint to Stafforth. It pleased her, and she smiled
at him. Stafforth, for his part, apparently paid no heed to
the rebuff, though Wilhelmine surprised an ugly glance and
a faint deepening of the hue of his coarsely chiselled, handsome
face. At this moment Madame de Ruth called them,
and they gathered round the table. They drank their coffee,
listening to a highly coloured story of the wars which Friedrich
Gr&auml;venitz was recounting. His Grace the Duke of Marlborough,
the hero thereof, a sorry figure, as the reluctant
victim of a lady of Ingolstadt, whose advances he refused,
trembling lest his haughty Sarah should hear of it and give
him a sound rating on his return to England. The anecdote
was broad, to say the least, and sure it did not lose in the
telling. 'A great captain, but sorely afraid of his lady!'
finished Gr&auml;venitz with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>'It is the privilege of the truly brave to tremble before
beauty and gentleness,' said Zollern sharply.</p>

<p>'The prerogative of fools to set them at naught,' he added
in a low voice to Madame de Ruth. There was a pause.
Gr&auml;venitz himself, who should have been uncomfortable,
seemed to notice nothing, but the rest of the company felt
the moment to be one of difficulty. Stafforth offered his
arm to Wilhelmine and proposed a short stroll through the
garden to the orchard; and the girl, glad to escape the spectacle
of her brother's swaggering tactlessness, accepted, and they
walked away together beneath the tender green of the beech-trees.</p>

<p>The orchard was an enchanted spot, such a marvel of
blossom overhead, like rose-tinted foam, while under foot
the grass was full of spring flowers, the cow-parsley sending
up a delicious faint fragrance, mingled with the smell of the
earth wet from the night's rain. Stafforth found a stack of
orchard poles, and dragging from beneath the heap the
dryest of them, he arranged a resting-place for Wilhelmine.
They sat down, and he recounted stories of court life in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
general and of Stuttgart in particular. He portrayed the
Duchess Johanna Elizabetha, a Princess of Baden-Durlach
by birth. He told of her good qualities, but also of her
dullness; of her eternal jealousy of her husband, Eberhard
Ludwig, Duke of Wirtemberg; of how the Duke sought entertainment
with other ladies, but that the reign of each was
short-lived, for the Duke really had a faithful soul and returned
to his excellent, wearisome spouse. How a Madame
de Geyling was queen of the present hour; that she was a
foolish woman with a bad temper, who offended the courtiers
and rated the Duke; of how the court expected an imminent
change of affection, but that no one could imagine who the
new favourite would be. He told her that the Duke was
a brilliant soldier, the friend and companion-in-arms of his
Grace of Marlborough, a polished courtier too, the finest dancer
of his day, and a very Ph&aelig;ton with horses. Withal a man
of learning and refinement, a passionate lover of music, a
dreamer and a child of Nature, who loved to wander alone
in the beautiful Wirtemberg forests, and often in the summer
would stay in the woods all night, sleeping upon the soft,
brown carpet of last year's leaves. Stafforth spoke of the perpetual
intrigues of the Romish priests to convert the Duke
and gain the country back to the Catholic Church; he told
her stories of the French invasion of Wirtemberg, and how it
was feared that the French would return to the attack, and
that therefore the Duke was occupied in Stuttgart gathering a
new army, though he masked those preparations by a series
of brilliant court gaieties. 'There is to be a magnificent feast
in a few weeks' time at Stuttgart, theatricals, a banquet, a
stag-hunt, and a grand ball. Will you honour my wife and
me by accepting our hospitality for that time? Your brother
has rooms in the quarters set apart for the Kammerjunkers;
Madame de Ruth also has but a small apartment in the
castle, not large enough to entertain a guest. But I have
a house with ample accommodation, and it would give me
much pleasure if you would come. Madame de Stafforth
too,' he added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine accepted. She felt that this was no sudden
proposition but an organised scheme, probably of Madame
de Ruth's.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
'You must play a part in the theatricals, Mademoiselle. The
rehearsals begin next week; will you come then?'</p>

<p>'Let us go and consult Madame de Ruth,' she replied, rising.</p>

<p>They rejoined the group round the table, and Stafforth made
his proposal as though it were a new idea which had come to
him. Madame de Ruth feigned surprise; Gr&auml;venitz played
the part of the grateful brother; Zollern acclaimed the notion
as excellent. Wherefore all this comedy? thought Wilhelmine,
for she realised that her programme had been fixed by these
schemers, and that this was merely the first act. She looked
round: ah, yes, Reischach! he was the audience for this play-acting.
He was intended to remain ignorant. Wilhelmine
smiled; she was in the presence of three practised intriguers&mdash;Zollern,
Madame de Ruth, Stafforth. She herself was to be
a tool, as her brother already was. Well, let their scheme
carry her as far as it could; afterwards, she promised herself
to go onward aided by her own ingenuity alone, once she knew
her ground. At present she was not sure at whom the plot
was aimed, though she had a suspicion that it was the Duke
himself whom she was designed to capture, in order to further
some unknown plans of her three protectors. She did not
count her brother; she recognised him as a mere pawn in the
game.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle to take part in the theatricals?' Madame
de Ruth was saying; 'delightful! but which part? You must
sing, my dear. Your brother says your voice is wonderful!
Let us hear you now. Come, mes amis! music!' Reischach
led the newcomer to the clavichord in the panelled room, and
the company gathered near the garden-door to listen.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine ran her fingers over the keyboard. The instrument
was old, and though the notes rang true, they were faint
and jingly. A lesser artist might have endeavoured to amplify
the chords, but Wilhelmine played her accompaniment in thin
arpeggios, making the clavichord sound like a stringed instrument,
and achieving a charming effect. She sang a gay little
sixteenth-century song, such a one as perchance Chastelard
may have sung to Marie of Scots in their happy days in
France&mdash;a light melody, with a sudden change to the minor
in the refrain, like a sigh following laughter. Wilhelmine's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
hearers, who had expected a beautiful, untrained voice from
this provincial lady, listened in unfeigned surprise, and when
the song was ended they crowded round her with expressions
of delight.</p>

<p>'We have found a pearl!' declared Madame de Ruth.
'Stafforth, what is this play which they are going to act at
Stuttgart? Who sings in it? Madame de Geyling?&mdash;of course!
Well, and after?&mdash;no one? Well, then, Mademoiselle shall
sing! Let it come as a surprise!'</p>

<p>Reischach approached.</p>

<p>'Monsieur de Reischach, I count you in our plot! We want
our new friend to make a sensation in Stuttgart. We can
rely on your discretion? Let her come as a surprise, I beg
you! Remember that the lute of Orpheus itself could not
have charmed the beasts had they been warned to expect too
much.'</p>

<p>Reischach bowed. 'No word from me, Madame, to warn&mdash;the
beasts!'</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth laughed. 'Do not apply my allegory
literally,' she said.</p>

<p>The company broke up; the Duke of Zollern's coach was at
the door. Also Monsieur de Stafforth took his leave, for he
intended to ride to Stuttgart that evening.</p>

<p>As Zollern bade farewell to his hostess, she whispered, 'She
will do admirably! she will go far.'</p>

<p>'Too far, perhaps, Madame,' he answered; 'too far for all
our calculations, and for many people's comfort!'</p>

<h3>THE PLAY-ACTING</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> eight of the clock on the evening of 15th May 1706, the
main street of Stuttgart was crowded with a stream of coaches
and foot-passengers. The cries of the running footmen:
'Make way there for his Highness the Duke of Zollern!'
'Room for the high and nobly born Freifrau von Geyling!'
'Let pass the coach of the gracious Countess Gemmingen!'
'Ho, there! for the Witgenstein's coach!' mixed with the
comments of the rabble of sightseers, and the retorts of the
substantial burghers who were piloting their wives and
daughters through the mob. All these wayfarers were bound
for the great dancing-hall in the Lusthaus, whither they were
bidden by Serenissimus, the magnificent Duke Eberhard
Ludwig of Wirtemberg, who had commanded a brilliant ball
as commencement of a series of festivities. There was to be
a grand hunt in the Red Wood, and finally court theatricals
in his Highness's own playhouse. The beautiful castle gardens
were illuminated with a myriad coloured lamps in the trees;
the rose-garden had become an enchanted bower, with little
lanterns twinkling in each rose-bush, and the fountain in the
centre was so lit up with varied lights that the spray assumed
a thousand hues. Hidden bands of musicians played in the
garden, and, in fact, it was said that Stuttgart would never
have witnessed such a brilliant festival. The Duke had
travelled in many lands&mdash;to France, where the court had
been so gay and fine before its King Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> became a
death-fearing, trembling bigot, dragging out the last years of
a dissipated life in terrified prayers. Poor Roi Soleil, become
the creature of his mistress, Madame la Marquise de Maintenon!
Still, though Eberhard Ludwig had not been in time
to witness this first splendour, he had been able to learn in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
France of how fine feasts should be ordered. He had been
in England too, though he could not have seen much there
in the dull days of William of Nassau, or of good, ponderous
Queen Anne; yet all travel teaches, and evidently the Duke
had learnt its pleasant lesson well.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine sat in Monsieur de Stafforth's fine coach with
Madame de Stafforth&mdash;a gentle, silent lady, whom Stafforth
had chosen for her noble birth and yielding ways. She was
perfectly unimportant; Stafforth never considered her, and the
only person who was known to notice her was her Highness
Johanna Elizabetha, who was, indeed, something akin to her
in nature. Madame de Stafforth sat meekly on the back seat
of her husband's splendid coach, leaving the place of honour
on the front seat to her husband and his guest, rewarded
sufficiently for her diffidence by a smile which her handsome
lord threw her, as he lay back on the yellow satin cushions of
his over-decorated coach.</p>

<p>It was but a step to the castle gate, and as Oberhofmarshall
Stafforth might have walked through the Duke's private
garden and gained a side entrance to the castle, and thence
traversed the short distance to the Lusthaus, but he chose
rather to drive through the crowd in order to arrive with
ostentatious flourish.</p>

<p>The coach drew up at the entrance, and many curious eyes
were fixed upon the Oberhofmarshall as he led his guest through
the throng to the door of the disrobing room. Madame de
Stafforth followed, and, being unable to push her way so
quickly past the people, it was a moment or two before she rejoined
Wilhelmine, who was removing her wrap in a leisurely
way while the other ladies there eyed her rudely. It was
very like the advent of a strange bird into a cage of canaries;
the indigenous birds were all prepared to peck at the
intruder. How willingly would they have torn out the
strange bird's feathers! Wilhelmine appeared unconscious of
this unfriendly scrutiny, though, in reality, she was disagreeably
aware of it. Madame de Stafforth had torn the hem
of her skirt walking through the crowded antehall, and
she begged the attendant to sew it for her. Wilhelmine was
obliged to wait, and nearly all the company had streamed into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
the dancing-hall before the two ladies were ready. Fate
played Wilhelmine a nasty trick in this&mdash;a throw-back in fact;
for when they reached the hall the effect of their entrance was
hidden by the crowd, and his Highness Eberhard Ludwig had
already left the da&iuml;s before which the courtiers passed and
bowed. Only her Highness Johanna Elizabetha remained
to receive the salutes of the late arrivals.</p>

<p>Stafforth had hurried away; the Duchess was so unimportant,
poor soul! and he could make his bow to her later in
the evening. Besides, he had his duties to attend to: he must
glance at the long supper-tables in the apartment adjoining
the dancing-hall, he must see that all the arrangements were
perfect. So Madame de Stafforth presented Fr&auml;ulein Wilhelmine
von Gr&auml;venitz to her Highness Johanna Elizabetha,
Duchess of Wirtemberg. The dull, amiable woman gave
Wilhelmine her hand to kiss and turned away, indifferent,
unconcerned. So little do we know when we first approach
the enemies of our lives! With those we are to love it is
often the same. We touch the hand which is fated to give
life's gift of joy to us, and we pass on unconscious that Destiny
has spoken. Sometimes we would barter a year of our life to
recall that first touch.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine stood at the foot of the da&iuml;s before the Duchess,
who was exchanging moth-dull confidences with Madame de
Stafforth. The crowd moved before the girl's eyes, and she
felt bewildered, dizzy, in a dream, for she was unaccustomed
to crowds. At length she saw Stafforth coming towards her.
He looked very fine in his court dress: the long, blue silk overcoat
richly embroidered in gold, the embroidered waistcoat of
white satin, white silk hose, and blue satin shoes with high
red heels and enormous diamond buckles. He carried the
Oberhofmarshall's staff of office in his left hand, and on
his breast shone the insignia of several high orders. His
curled wig was much powdered, and his healthy, coarse
face seemed to gain in refinement thereby, softened in
outline by the white hair. Very fine was the bow he
made as he said: 'Mademoiselle, may I entreat the honour
of your hand for the pavane? Serenissimus dances in the
same set. You know the pavane?' he added anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
'His Highness is quicker to detect a fault in dancing than
to pardon it.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine had danced the pavane with M. Gabriel in
the schoolhouse at G&uuml;strow, and he had told her that her
dancing was perfect enough for the court of France itself;
so she accepted Monsieur de Stafforth's hand without
hesitation.</p>

<p>He led her to the middle of the dancing-hall, and stood
beside her, waiting for the Duke to give the sign to the
musicians to commence. It was scarcely correct for
Wilhelmine to dance in the Duke's pavane before she had
been presented to his Highness, but Stafforth told her that
the Duke desired all presentations to be made in the pause
after the figure dance, which was to take place later in the
evening. Wilhelmine reflected that she would be at liberty
to observe Eberhard Ludwig at her leisure during the
dance. She looked round, but the Duke was not yet visible.
Stafforth pointed to an alcove, telling her that his Highness
was there talking to Madame de Geyling. At length the
curtains of the recess were pushed aside and a tall figure
appeared. Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Wirtemberg, leading
his favourite, Madame de Geyling, by the hand. A princely
figure indeed, thought Wilhelmine, as she bent low in the
elaborate courtesy with which the dancers greeted their Duke.
He was tall and slight, dressed in ivory-coloured satin; his
breast glittered with magnificent orders, the broad orange
ribbon of the newly instituted Prussian order of the Black
Eagle being the only variation in the uniform whiteness of
his attire. He looked the very figure of a prince of romance,
and the gentlemen who bowed before him seemed to be popinjays
in their over-gorgeous clothes.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, his blue eyes flashing round the circle
of dancers, then he raised his hand in sign to the musicians
to commence, and turning to Madame de Geyling bowed profoundly.
The music rang out in the stately measure of the
pavane, and the dance began: the ladies gliding, bowing,
bending, their fans raised above their heads, then pressed
to their bosoms as they bowed again; the cavaliers no whit
behind them in elegance and grace. The court of Versailles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
itself had not danced better, for to dance badly meant disgrace
with the Duke of Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>The pavane ended, and Monsieur de Stafforth led Wilhelmine
to a seat near the da&iuml;s, where she found Madame de Ruth
resplendent in a green court dress. The two ladies settled
down to await the beginning of the figure dance, in which the
Duke himself was to take part. Madame de Ruth, voluble
as usual, questioned Wilhelmine closely upon the events of
the evening, and her face fell when she heard that the girl
had not been presented to his Highness&mdash;nay, more, had
danced near him without his deigning to notice her. 'Well,
my dear, never mind,' said Madame de Ruth, 'the most
victorious armies may suffer defeat at first.' As will be seen
by this speech, the object of Wilhelmine's campaign was no
longer a mystery, and the intriguers now spoke openly before
their intended tool. She knew that her goal was Eberhard
Ludwig himself, and the future seemed good to her since she
had seen Eberhard Ludwig. Also it all spelt 'fine clothes,
fine living, fine linen, gaiety, and perhaps power,' and as she
had once said to her friend Anna Reinhard at G&uuml;strow, without
these she could not imagine happiness. 'Mon enfant, it is
serious though,' Madame de Ruth was saying, 'the Duke never
looked at you? you are sure? Ah! he was staring at that
odious Geyling, I dare swear! Lord God! how I hate that
woman! She once asked me if I had any children, and
when I said "no," she inquired if I had any grandchildren!'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine laughed. 'She might have grandchildren herself,
I think,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes, my child, if you scraped the paint you might find the
grandmother beneath. Indeed, the Geyling is nearly as old
as I am,' laughed Madame de Ruth, delighted at Wilhelmine's
judgment of the woman whom she hated. 'But see,' she continued,
'here comes the figure dance.' As she spoke the doors
at the end of the dancing-hall opened, and the musicians in the
gallery began to play a lilting strain. Quite slowly through the
gilded doors came a tiny figure dressed in wreaths of leaves
and flowers, a golden bow in his hand, and at his side a
miniature quiver filled with paper arrows. 'The Geyling's
nephew,' said Madame de Ruth, 'and the only good thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
about her! A charmingly naughty child, who they hope, however,
will play his Cupid's r&ocirc;le to-night, though he is as likely
as not to do exactly the reverse, for he is by nature a god of
mischief!'</p>

<p>The child walked solemnly to the centre of the hall, and
there began to dance a rapid skipping measure, waving his
bow over his head the while.</p>

<p>The onlookers burst into applause. Then the music softened
to an accompaniment, and boys' voices from the musicians'
loft sang in parts.</p>

<p>'Bad verses, my dear,' grunted Madame de Ruth, 'yet a
pretty air. They say the Geyling wrote the rhymes&mdash;that
explains it!' But her grumble was lost to Wilhelmine, who
was observing the entry of four rather lightly clad nymphs,
who came forward in a graceful swaying line, encircling the
child, who stood stock-still in the midst wondering, poor mite,
if this long game would soon be ended. At length the four
nymphs sank to their knees before the boy, holding out their
arms to him, while the voices in the gallery warbled with
ever-increasing rapture.</p>

<p>The child ran from one kneeling figure to the other: first
to Mademoiselle de Gemmingen, then to Mademoiselle de
Varnb&uuml;ller, to Mademoiselle de Reischach, and before his
aunt, Madame de Geyling, the little fellow stopped and took
his aim, with his bow and paper arrows. Everything was
going admirably, never had this Cupid behaved so exactly as
arranged. Already the Geyling was feigning to fall backwards
in affected alarm, when Cupid whipped round saying, in
a high childish treble, 'Non, ma tante, je ne te choisis pas, tu
es trop m&eacute;chante!'</p>

<p>An audible titter went round the audience, for the Geyling
was universally disliked. Cupid now thoroughly entering
into the mischief of the game, ran round the group of nymphs
calling out, 'Ni toi! Ni toi! Je cherche une vraie reine!'
He paused irresolute for a moment, then, catching sight of
Wilhelmine's smiling face, he made a dash for her, exclaiming
loudly, 'Je te choisis, jolie dame!' and he shot his paper
arrow straight at her breast. There was a pause of consternation
among the dancers; this upset all the plans; and how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
could an untrained stranger execute the elaborate step of the
dance especially invented by his Highness's own dancing-master
for this occasion?</p>

<p>There was commotion in the audience: men pressed forward
to observe the scene, women fluttered their fans and whispered
together, the three nymphs tittered weakly, while Madame
de Geyling stood in the middle of the hall with heaving bosom
and angry face. Madame de Ruth was laughing, and even
the Duchess had risen from her chair and was leaning on
Madame de Stafforth's shoulder, smiling and nodding.
Wilhelmine had caught Cupid up in her arms, and he was
laughing and shouting and sticking the little paper arrows in
her hair. The musicians ceased playing, waiting for the
chosen nymph to begin the 'Dance of Joy,' which preceded the
entrance of the Duke in the character of Prince Charming.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine whispered to Madame de Ruth: 'What shall
I do? I don't know the dance&mdash;the Duke would never
forgive&mdash;advise me quickly!'</p>

<p>'Don't dance, but make the Duke notice you,' whispered the
old woman.</p>

<p>The girl rose, Cupid still in her arms, and began to walk
slowly across the hall towards the door whence the Duke
must appear. The musicians, mistaking her for some personage
of the masque, struck up the 'Dance of Joy.' Now
Wilhelmine possessed immense dramatic perceptions, also
she knew she could dance, so without hesitation she began
to execute a long sliding measure in perfect harmony with
the music, though it was, of course, an impromptu of her
own. She danced half-way round the hall, holding Cupid
high in the air in her strong arms. Meanwhile the Duke, all
unknowing, appeared in the doorway in his appointed place.
Wilhelmine glided up to him, and sinking on one knee with
Cupid held up to his Highness, she said, 'Cupid has made a
mistake, Monseigneur. He was always a blind god. Pardon,
Monseigneur, and permit Sa Majest&eacute; l'Amour to choose
again!' With that she set the child down and ran through
the door past the Duke, who, astounded, remained standing
holding Cupid by the hand. He heard the applause which
had broken forth in the hall, and he saw the Geyling's furious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
face, and, realising that something unexpected had occurred,
he came forward quickly.</p>

<p>'A mistake, Madame,' he said shortly as he reached the
Geyling. 'Let us endeavour to obliterate it by your grace!'
And he commanded the musicians to play the new dance, but
he danced unevenly, constantly glancing in the direction of
the door where Wilhelmine had disappeared. Madame de
Ruth watched for a moment, and then, with a nod to Stafforth
who stood beside the da&iuml;s in evident perplexity, she turned
and went to seek Wilhelmine.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day Stuttgart talked much of the handsome
stranger whom Cupid had chosen to dance with the Duke,
and conjecture was rife as to who she could be. Then it
leaked out that she was to sing in the theatricals that night,
and the curious, which means each person in or near a
court, were on tiptoe with expectation.</p>

<p>Many looked for her at the stag-hunt in the Red Wood
that day, and Madame de Ruth, who had the reputation of
knowing everything, was fairly besieged by questioners.
She told them so little, though in so many words, that they
were all the more anxious to be informed further. But what
part was the unknown to take in the theatricals? they asked
among themselves. She had not been seen at the rehearsals&mdash;strange&mdash;but
Madame de Ruth assured them that the mysterious
one was indeed to sing that night.</p>

<p>The chosen piece was La Fontaine's <i>Coupe Enchant&eacute;e</i>, a
pretty thing, and even decorous enough for the hearing of
Johanna Elizabetha; new too in Stuttgart, though Paris had
already forgotten it.</p>

<p>You may imagine that the invited guests were in their
places at the theatre in good time. Behind the scenes there
was much bustle and confusion. His Highness Eberhard
Ludwig, to say the least of it, was perturbed; he ran from
dressing-room to dressing-room, knocking and inquiring if the
players were there. When he came to the dressing-room set
apart for Madame de Geyling the door was opened suddenly,
almost knocking his Highness on the nose, and an angry
face appeared through the door's aperture. One side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
this face was painted for the stage, while the other was only
adorned with the pigments with which the Geyling was
accustomed to hide her ageing features. The Duke smiled:
I regret to say he actually laughed, and this laugh provoked
a torrent of angry words from the lady. His Highness retired
discomfited, and there were whispers behind the scenes of
how this must be one of the closing dramas of this lady's
reign.</p>

<p>The curtain parted and the comedy began. At first the
audience paid but scant attention to the play, but soon a
severe glance from the Duchess silenced the whispering
crowd.</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth's laughter led the chorus of approval at
each subtle speech, and they said 'Ah oui! que c'est fin!'
when she said it, for they did not trust their own judgment.
The Duke of Zollern leaned his chin on the back of his hands,
which he had crossed over the porcelain handle of his stick.
He was not amused; he thought it dull, which it was. The
Duchess paid no attention to the play; she was watching, in
her ponderous way, the marked respect and affection which
Eberhard Ludwig succeeded in showing Madame de Geyling
even through his acting, and she suffered, this poor, dull
woman. Madame de Stafforth sat near her, saying nothing as
usual. Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz stood leaning against the pillar
by the entrance to the parterre, looking handsome and sombre.
<i>La Coupe Enchant&eacute;e</i> went on its gay, subtle way, and was
followed by an allegorical dance&mdash;a medley of gods and
goddesses, of conventional shepherds and shepherdesses; a
graceful enough conceit withal, but involved and not very
amusing. At the end there came the only scene which
appeared to interest her Highness Johanna Elizabetha: the
little Erbprinz, her son, came on the stage dressed as Mars
the God of War, and was greeted with homage from the other
gods. Poor Johanna Elizabetha applauded and kissed her
hands to him, while she recounted to Madame de Stafforth a
hundred details of the child's health.</p>

<p>The curtain fell, and the audience prepared to depart.
Disappointment was rife, for the stranger had failed to appear,
and it seemed that the comedy was finished. The Duchess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
who had been seated in the foremost row of chairs, was
already moving away followed by her suite, when the
musicians recommenced to play, and it was whispered through
the assemblage that the Envoi had yet to be performed. Very
slowly the curtain was drawn aside and a darkened stage
disclosed. For a moment the music ceased, then took up a
haunting melody as a tall, white figure approached down the
almost unlit stage. It was a young woman in flowing, classic
draperies&mdash;a goddess she looked; and after the mincing
shepherdesses and their artificial, conventional mannerisms,
this woman came as a breath from Nature's grandeur, young,
forceful, untrammelled. She came right down to the half-lit
footlights, and stood motionless during a bar or two of the
music. And then she sang, and the audience, tittering
curiously before, remained spellbound, awe-struck, as the
first notes of that matchless voice smote upon their hearing.
She sang of the sadness of the ending of comedies, of the
regret which lingers in the remembrance of past laughter.
In a couplet of passionate melancholy she asked, where are
the roses of yesterday? whither vanish the songs of
to-day?</p>

<p>Changing verse and melody to a soft <i>r&eacute;citatif</i>, she begged
her hearers to give good favour to the evening's festivities.
She reminded them that the merry company would soon
disperse for many months; she wished them peace and
happiness, and she prayed that another spring would find the
company reunited once again. 'Mars, God of War, hold thy
hand; touch not this fair country!'</p>

<p>In her singing she had struck that note of regret which never
leaves an audience unmoved; she appealed to the sadness which
lingers for ever in the heart of man, and, after the vapid
brilliancies of La Fontaine's comedy, the strain had all the
greater power to stir. Wilhelmine, an unseen spectator at
many rehearsals of the theatricals, had calculated this to a
nicety, with an artist's instinct for playing upon human nature
and emotion.</p>

<p>There were women among the audience who knew that ere
the following spring many of those they loved might be shot
down by French bullets; there were men in the parterre who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
knew this, and a wave of emotion swept over the whole
audience. To the singer herself all this hardly mattered; the
human hearts were merely instruments upon which she played
a melody; yet her receptive, finely strung being thrilled in
response to the feeling she evoked; a half-sob rose in her throat
and flooded her flexible voice with a passion of sadness.
When the song ended, there came a moment's breathless
silence, then the applause broke forth, and Wilhelmine knew
she had achieved a triumph.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the banqueting-hall Duke Eberhard's guests were seated
at a magnificent repast. Five hundred ladies and gentlemen
at long tables on a raised platform, while in the lower portion
of the hall the burghers of Stuttgart were regaled with wine
and cake. Her Highness Johanna Elizabetha sat at one
table with her retinue; Serenissimus at another with his suite
and closest friends, at his right hand was Madame de Geyling.
Stafforth was seated at this table, Madame de Ruth was there
also, Monseigneur the Duke of Zollern, of course, and Prelate
Osiander. The Geyling discussed the comedy. Lifting her
glass she toasted Eberhard Ludwig: 'I drink to your Highness
from la Coupe Enchant&eacute;e,' she murmured; but the Duke
answered absently, and Madame de Ruth smiled when he
asked Stafforth, 'Where is the goddess of sound? Has she
vanished with her divine song?' He was told that the lady
had retired to rerobe herself. 'Robe herself, you mean!' said
the Geyling sharply, 'she had, in truth, little to remove!'
She spoke quickly to the Duke in an undertone, but his
Highness turned away and commanded Stafforth to present the
singer directly she appeared.</p>

<p>The Geyling bit her underlip&mdash;there was a pause in the
talk at the Duke's table.</p>

<p>At length a door near the platform opened, and Wilhelmine
appeared. No one noticed her at first, and she stood for a
moment hesitating in the doorway; then Madame de Ruth
espied her, and, craving the Duke's pardon, she rose and
went to Wilhelmine and, taking her by the hand, led her
towards the Duke. It was necessary to pass the Duchess's
table; Wilhelmine immediately recognised her Highness, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
as she passed she swept Johanna Elizabetha a deep courtesy.
It was gracefully done, and the neglected lady, unaccustomed
to be treated with even ordinary consideration, responded by
an amiable smile. As they approached the Duke, his Highness
rose and came forward to meet them. He had seen
Wilhelmine's spontaneous good manners and was gratified
thereby. Nothing gratifies a grand seigneur more than the
grand manner, and in return to Wilhelmine's inclination his
Highness bowed as though to a queen.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle, I am deeply in your debt,' he said; 'it
would be banal to thank you for your divine music, yet
permit me to say that I would willingly keep you for ever as
my creditor, if you would but promise to make my debt the
greater by singing to me again&mdash;and soon.'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, you do me too much honour,' she responded,
sinking to the ground in another courtesy.</p>

<p>'To a feast of the gods you would be welcome, Mademoiselle;
but as we are not in Olympus, let me, at least, lead
the Goddess of Song to my poor table for refreshment.' So
saying, his Highness offered his hand and led her to his
table. He presented her to Madame de Geyling, who gave
her a bitter-sweet smile and paid her the compliment of
turning her back upon her. The Duke plied his guest with
food and wine, declaring that ambrosia and nectar were
better fitted for her; he toasted her; he praised her; he
exhausted his knowledge of mythology in her honour, calling
her Melpomene, the tragic Muse, for had she not made men
weep with her song that very night? Song, did he say? nay,
hymn it was! She was Polyhymnia, singer of sublimity.
He named her Philom&egrave;le, and desired the lute of Orpheus
that he might play an accompaniment to her wondrous singing.
He asked her in which enchanted ocean she had lived.
'Mademoiselle Sir&egrave;ne, lurer of men's souls,' he called her.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine spoke little in answer to all this, but she acted
her part well, smiling at him with glistening eyes. Indeed,
she found no difficulty herein, for her heart had played a
cleverer trick than ever her brain had devised&mdash;she was falling
in love with Eberhard Ludwig of Wirtemberg. When supper
was over the Duke rose, and, in defiance of etiquette, desired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
Stafforth to accompany Madame de Geyling, while he himself
led Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz from the banqueting-hall. They
passed on to the terrace, above the outer colonnade of the
Lusthaus, and stood together looking down on the garden, and
the strains from the instruments of the musicians hidden in the
bowers floated up to them.</p>

<p>'I hardly dare propose it, Mademoiselle,' said the Duke after
some moments' silence, 'but the garden is very fair to-night;
would you honour me by accepting my arm and taking a short
stroll towards the fountain? Only a few minutes, the night
is so beautiful&mdash;come and look at the stars with me!'</p>

<p>She hesitated; but the man's face was so noble, so open.
Why not? 'Monseigneur, I know not,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle, I entreat. If you knew how I hate these
crowded rooms. I am a soldier, and I love the memory of
those nights encamped in the open, when I left my tent
and wandered alone beneath the stars. Forstner&mdash;you
know Forstner? No? Well&mdash;a good friend, yet always at
my elbow with rebukes and etiquette! Well&mdash;old Forstner
used to chide me, saying it was not fitting for a reigning
Duke to wander alone "like a ridiculous poet-fellow philandering
with the stars," as he called it. Ah! Mademoiselle,
will you leave the Duke here on the balcony, and come and
look at the stars with the ridiculous poet-fellow? will you?'</p>

<p>Who could resist him, this man with the pleading eyes and
deep, strong voice? And Wilhelmine, coming from Mecklemburg
to make a career, had begun it already, God knows!
by falling in love with the Duke. They went down the
steps leading to the garden, and in silence walked along the
path towards the fountain. The moon played white over the
flowers, and the sound of the violins, harps, and zithers faded
away in the distance. They reached an old stone seat
beneath a beech-tree and sat down. Before them the fountain
rose, like some shimmering witch in the moonlight.</p>

<p>'Sing me a snatch of some song, Mademoiselle,' said
Eberhard Ludwig. 'There is no one near; sing to me once, to
<i>me alone</i>&mdash;to the silly poet-fellow!<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins></p>

<p>'Nay, Monseigneur,' she answered tremulously, 'I cannot
sing&mdash;my heart is beating in my throat somehow.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
He looked at her in the moonlight.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz,' he said, 'I have never been
so happy, yet so unutterably sad, as at this moment. I&mdash;I&mdash;Mademoiselle&mdash;&mdash;'
and his voice broke. He took her
hand in his and, raising it to his lips, kissed it once, twice,
then in a husky voice he said, 'We must go back.' He
rose from the seat, offering her his arm. He led her up the
dark garden-path and into the glitter of lights in the ante-hall
of the Lusthaus, where Madame de Stafforth stood ready
to depart, waiting for Wilhelmine. The Duke sent Stafforth
for Mademoiselle's cloak, and when he brought it, his Highness
himself wrapped it round her. As he did so, his hand involuntarily
touched the soft skin of her shoulder, and Eberhard
Ludwig flushed to the edge of his white curled peruke as he
murmured: 'Au revoir, Philom&egrave;le!' and Wilhelmine daringly
whispered back: 'Au revoir, gentil po&egrave;te.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hofmarshall's house stood in the 'Graben,' a broad road
which ran proudly past the old town ending at the ducal
gardens on the west, while to the east began the fields and
vineyards leading up to the royal hunting forest, the Rothwald.
Stafforth's house was a fine stone building decorated
with rococo masks. To the back lay a beautiful garden
laid out on a plan of M. Len&ocirc;tre's, from whose book of
<i>Jardins Mignons</i> Stafforth had selected it. On the morning
after the theatricals Wilhelmine was seated on one of the
garden benches, and though her eyes were fixed on the pages
of a French translation of Barclay's satirical novel <i>Argenis</i>,
her thoughts were busy with the events of the previous
evening. Her reverie was interrupted by Madame de Ruth
who arrived, as usual, in a cloud of her own words. She
embraced Wilhelmine affectionately, exclaiming: 'Never was
there so great a victory! One battle and the country is
ours! The hero at your feet, my dear! Did I not say that
you had a great future before you? Ah! the Geyling!
Ha! ha! ha! what a face she made when his Highness led
you out on to the balcony, and I asked her if she thought it
convenable for you! Ha! ha! ha! she looked sour indeed,
and she screeched at me in her peahen voice: "Mademoiselle
de Gr&auml;venitz seems to be a lady of experience; she can
guard her own young virtue, I suppose!" "'Tis not her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
virtue, Madame," I said, with a surprised look and the prim
manner of a Pietist, "I know <i>that</i> is safe with so devoted
a husband as Serenissimus, but I fear for her reputation!
Ah! Madame, the evil tongues of older women! and already
no one here to-night can speak of ought save Mademoiselle.
But I assure you the theatricals are not even mentioned,
Madame! They can remember nothing save the Envoi
and its singer." O Wilhelmine! if you could have seen
her face! I suffer, I expire with laughter, when I think of
it.' And Madame de Ruth laughed till she really was almost
suffocated, and was obliged to hold her hands over her
heaving sides.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine leaned her head on her hands. 'Poor Madame
de Geyling!' she said in a musing tone.</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth ceased laughing and looked at her piercingly.
'Poor Madame de Geyling?' she exclaimed. 'But,
my child! Ah!' and she caught Wilhelmine by the wrist;
'you pity her? because she has lost the Duke's affection?
Why?' She paused a moment&mdash;reflected. 'Girl! you have
fallen in love with Serenissimus,' she whispered.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine sprang up&mdash;her cheeks aflame. It was true,
and she knew it herself then for the first time. She was
angry, and yet there was an immense gladness in her heart.
Her eyes were wet, and she felt the pulses throbbing in her
temples. She was ashamed and yet gloriously proud.</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth watched her; at first, with smiling
curiosity, then the old woman's face softened, she took Wilhelmine's
hand and said gently: 'God give you joy, my child.
There, there&mdash;I am a foolish old woman&mdash;you make me weep.&mdash;Lord
God! but hearts are the great intriguers, not brains!'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine turned to her and, bending, kissed the old
courtesan on the brow.</p>

<p>'Madame,' she said, 'Madame, be my friend; I shall need
one in the days to come.'</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth drew the girl down beside her on the
bench, her face had grown suddenly old and infinitely sad.
'Yes,' she answered, 'I will be your friend. Do you know
that I had a little girl twenty years ago? She would have
been just your age now, had she lived, and perhaps I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
have been a different woman. Well, well&mdash;no sentiment,
my dear; it is so unsuitable, isn't it? but I will be your
friend.'</p>

<p>She kissed the young woman, and, rising hastily, took her
way towards the house.</p>

<hr />

<p>The days dragged slowly on in Stuttgart for Wilhelmine,
and there came no message from his Highness, who had gone
to Urach, they told her, to hunt. Though the court remained
nominally in Stuttgart while her Highness Johanna Elizabetha
resided at the castle, most of the courtiers had retired to the
country and Stuttgart was more than usually dull. Stafforth
had accompanied the Duke to Urach, so Wilhelmine remained
alone with Madame de Stafforth. The heat was terrible in
the town, which lay encircled by the vine-clad hills, as in a
great caldron. The Stuttgarters told her that such heat
was unusual at that time of year, but there was little consolation
for her in that.</p>

<p>To some natures dullness becomes an insupportable suffering.
Loneliness, all you will, they can bear, for they draw
occupation and joy from the depth of their own souls; but
that dreariness, which has been called dullness, is an almost
tangible presence at moments, and seems to blight the beauty
of all things. This Wilhelmine felt in those stifling days at
Stuttgart. Madame de Stafforth's moth-like personality
wearied her. Madame de Ruth, who had returned to Rottenburg,
wrote constantly imploring her friend to visit her; yet
something seemed to hold the girl, some mysterious sentiment,
that if she left Stuttgart she would turn her back on her
life.</p>

<p>Once or twice Wilhelmine accompanied Madame de
Stafforth to the castle. The Duchess received her with
amiable indifference, and the young woman stood silently by
while the two dull women discussed their habitual uninteresting
topics.</p>

<p>It was perfectly unreasonable, but she felt a hatred
growing in her heart for the wife of Eberhard Ludwig.</p>

<p>One morning towards the end of June, Wilhelmine awoke
to find the grey dawn creeping in at her window; she rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
and opened the casement and leaned out. Her room looked
on the formal garden. There was a solemn hush in the air,
and she realised that even the birds were asleep. Far
in the east, over the top of the one beech-tree which still
stood in the garden in spite of M. Len&ocirc;tre, the rising sun was
tingeing the horizon with a delicate rosy glow. A bird
stirred&mdash;twittered&mdash;finally a clear note of welcome to the day
rang out, and the world was awake. The radiance in the
east grew brighter, long streaks of glorious colour invaded the
soft grey of dawn. From the distant field roads came the
rumble of a peasant's cart. Wilhelmine dressed herself
hurriedly and tiptoed down the dark stair to the house door.
The broad street, the Graben, was deserted and silent, save for
an occasional rattle in the direction of the market-place,
where the peasants were arriving from the country with their
carts heaped up with fresh fruit and vegetables. She walked
up the street, delighting in the coolness and the scent of the
morning air after the long days of oppressive heat which she
had endured. A fancy took her to wander in the Rothwald,
and she walked briskly along, up the dusty country path
which led to the wood on the hill. The sun had risen, and
even at that early hour the heat was so great that once or
twice Wilhelmine almost turned homewards; however, the
thought of the cool shade of the beech-trees in the forest drew
her, and she pressed onward. At length she reached the edge
of the wood, and, turning, she contemplated the steep hill
which she had climbed from the town. The rough country
road wound like some white riband through the green vineyards
which lay between Stuttgart and the Rothwald. A
light breeze sprang up and stirred the long, lush grass of the
field which bordered the shadow of the trees. There is no
part of a forest more beautiful than the line where wood
begins and meadow ends; it is as the lip of the forest breathing
forth in a fragrant kiss of poesy some mystery of silent
dells and fairy's haunts, which it hints of but does not quite
betray. Wilhelmine mused on this; she was gifted with a
delicate appreciation of each beauty-forming detail, and the
accurate observation without which the enjoyment of beauty
is a mere sensuous mood. She paused a while, drinking in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
freshness and revelling in the solitude; then she entered the
wood and walked onward, her feet sinking deep into the rich
moss. She inhaled the delicious smell of the beech-trees,
that light odour of the northern forest which is almost imperceptible,
and yet so fresh, so pungent. It is made up of the
smell of earth, of moss, of fern, of grass and leaves, and the
resinous health of young pine. As Wilhelmine walked, she
whispered a melody half in greeting to the trees, half
mechanically. She found a shallow bank, and, seating herself
on the ground, she supported her shoulders against the
slope. She leaned her head back and gazed up into Spring's
wonderful tracery in the myriad beech-leaves, and the cool
green fell like balsam on her eyes. A breeze stirred the
tree-tops, and for a moment they swayed and leaned together
whisperingly, then, like little children playing at some gentle
teasing game, they drew back as the breeze passed.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine's thoughts wandered to Eberhard Ludwig; of
a truth they knew the way, for how often had they sought
his memory since that night in the castle garden? She
pondered how she had been told his Highness loved to sleep
in the forest. 'Ridiculous poet-fellow' he had called himself.
She drew a deep breath. 'Au revoir, Philom&egrave;le,' he had said.
Ah! but he had forgotten her! Madame de Ruth had been
mistaken! The campaign was not won. Wilhelmine's cheeks
glowed suddenly, she crushed a leaf of an overhanging beech-branch;
it was intolerable. All those people would ridicule
her! Leaning her head in her hand, she pressed her fingers
against her eyes to shut out the sunlight, but it lingered in
her eyeballs, and against the blackness she saw dancing rays
of blinding light. A feeling of delightful drowsiness was
coming over her&mdash;a far-away feeling. Presently she raised
her head from her hands, and once more contemplated the
peaceful wood. What did she care for those people who
would mock her? She would return their malevolent stares
with her evil look, which she knew would be eminently disagreeable
to them. Her thoughts turned back to G&uuml;strow
now&mdash;G&uuml;strow and Monsieur Gabriel. Almost unconsciously,
as she thought of her old friend, she found herself humming
an air. At first she but whispered it under her breath, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>
she was gradually carried away by the physical enjoyment of
letting forth her powerful voice, and she burst into full song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Bois &eacute;pais redouble ton ombre,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Tu ne saurais &ecirc;tre assez sombre.</p>
<p class="ihalf">Tu ne peux trop cacher</p>
<p class="ihalf">Mon malheureux amour!</p>
<p class="ihalf">Je sens un d&eacute;sespoir,</p>
<p class="ihalf">Dont l'horreur est extr&ecirc;me.</p>
<p class="ihalf">Je ne dois plus voir</p>
<p class="ihalf">Ce que j'aime&mdash;</p>
<p class="ihalf">Je ne veux plus souffrir le jour!'</p>
</div></div>

<p>She sang the old French melody out into the trees, and the
great notes thrilled and echoed through the wood till it was
as though they had become an integrant part of the forest.
Her voice was truly a woman's voice in the ineffable tenderness
and the grand passion of it, but there lay in its tones
a depth of strong uncompromising nobility which lives in
an organ's notes or in the rich low chords of a violoncello.
Truly, as Monsieur Gabriel had said, her voice belonged by
right to the shadowy cathedrals, for each note seemed a
sacred thing, a homage to God, and itself deserving to be
worshipped in reverent devotion. During the song Wilhelmine
had not heard the sound of approaching footsteps, nor did she
observe how a hand pushed aside some branches not far from
where she sat, and a man's head and shoulders appeared. She
leaned back on the moss for a moment's rest, and then springing
up recommenced to sing. She stood very straight and
tall, her hands locked together behind her, like a schoolgirl
reciting a lesson; somehow this childlike attitude added by
its simplicity to the woman's dignity. Her head was held a
little back, chin tilted upwards, and the eyes looked far away
as though they beheld a whole world of dreams and lovely
melody beyond all save the singer's ken. As she sang the
colour mounted slowly to her cheeks, flooding her face with a
divine flush; perhaps her very heart's blood rushed to adore
the tones which fell from her lips. The man watching held
his breath. She finished her song on a clear high note, and
as she gave it forth, she flung back her head in an impulsive
gesture, glorying in an ecstasy of sound, a magnificence of
accomplishment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
When the echo of the last ringing note faded, the man
sprang forward, and, throwing himself impetuously on his
knees before Wilhelmine, he raised the hem of her gown to
his lips in a passionate gesture, though with the adoring
reverence that all poets give to great singers.</p>

<p>'Philom&egrave;le!' he murmured. 'Ah! Philom&egrave;le! Beloved!'</p>

<p>She looked down at him. How strangely natural, necessary,
unsurprising it seemed to her that he should be kneeling there,
and yet she thought herself in some oft-remembered dream.</p>

<p>'Gentil po&egrave;te,' she whispered back, and her hand fell on his
shoulder. His hand sought hers, he caught it and kissed it
with a sort of piety.</p>

<p>'I love you.' He spoke the words like a prayer. She drew
away from him.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' she said, 'I thought you had forgotten
me!' He started at her gesture of repulsion and at the
formal word.</p>

<p>'You are a woman no man can forget,' he answered. Then
he told her how that evening in the castle garden he had
known he loved her; how he had dreaded giving himself up
to a passion which he divined would prove so absorbing as to
turn him from his cherished military ambition. He poured
out to her his life's history, all his dreams of brilliant feats of
arms, the raising of his duchy to a kingdom; he told her of
his bitter disappointment when he found these ambitions were
incomprehensible to the Duchess Johanna Elizabetha; of how,
gradually, he had awakened to the fact that he was tied to a
woman who utterly lacked in sympathy, and thus wearied
him and drove him to seek consolation and amusement in the
light loves and fancies of court gallantry, and then how each
lady's charms had palled inevitably.</p>

<p>'And now,' he paused, 'now I feel that all my life began
when first I heard your voice! I have been fighting with my
thoughts ever since. Beloved! I have nothing to offer you&mdash;you
are too pure to take the only position I could give you&mdash;and
I love you too well to ask you.'</p>

<p>She looked at him, and a smile touched her lips and
vanished almost before it was born.</p>

<p>'Mon po&egrave;te,' she whispered, and stretched out both hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
to him; he took them in his, and drew her towards him.
One thick curl of hair had fallen forward on her neck, he
lifted it and buried his face in it, kissing it wildly, breathing
in its fragrance.</p>

<p>'I love you,' he said again, and drew her, unresisting, into
his arms. 'Philom&egrave;le! Ah!' and his lips met hers.</p>

<p>Overhead a bird burst forth into a rhapsody of song.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE FULFILMENT</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> began for Wilhelmine a time of strangely mixed and
contending emotions. She loved Eberhard Ludwig with all
that fervour and lavish freshness which we give to our first
love; she longed to surrender to his passion, yet she held back
with a modesty of maidenly reserve which her many jealous
enemies ascribed to calculation, or else entirely denied,
alleging that she was a mere adventuress plying her illicit
trade according to her habit. Of a truth, there may have
been a shade of strategy in her virtuous hesitation, for
Madame de Ruth, who had returned to Stuttgart post-haste
on hearing of his Highness's advent, constantly counselled
her to hold back. Wilhelmine herself realised that a battle's
importance is generally gauged by its difficulty, and the ultimate
victory more highly prized if hardly won. Sometimes
she wondered why she knew these things, and laughingly she
told Madame de Ruth of this.</p>

<p>'Dear child,' said the old woman with her thin, satirical
smile, 'we women come into the world knowing such things;
whereas men&mdash;poor, beloved fools!&mdash;need experience, philosophy,
and the Lord knows what, to teach them. Alas! by the
time they have learned they no longer need their knowledge,
for by that time cruel old age has got them in its grey, dull
clutches.'</p>

<p>Another factor in Wilhelmine's life at that time was the
Duke's friend Baron Forstner, a man of excellent and sterling
qualities, but one of those unfortunate mortals cursed
with a lugubrious manner which makes their goodness seem to
be but one more irritating characteristic of a tiresome personality.
Forstner was genuinely devoted to the Duke; he had
been the companion of the Prince's childhood, had shared his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
studies, and had followed him on his travels to the various
European courts and in the campaigns where Eberhard Ludwig
had so mightily distinguished himself. How cruel it is
that devotion may be so entirely masked by some wearisome
trait, as to turn the whole affection into a source of irritation
to its object! Forstner perpetually reminded his Highness
of his duty.</p>

<p>Now Eberhard Ludwig was possessed of a high regard for
that stern code of life which is called Duty; he had all a
soldier's respect for rule, for obedience, all a gentleman's
reverence for honour and truth; yet these things, as presented
by Forstner, were to him odious, and his first impulse was to
go counter to any advice proffered in the drab-coloured guise
of Forstner's counsel, and by his deep, dreary voice.</p>

<p>'L'osseux,' the Bony One, Madame de Ruth dubbed him;
and truly the sobriquet was justified, for the man was so long
and thin as to give the impression of bones strung on strings.
He walked in jerks: his flat, narrow feet posed precisely, the
head held forward, like some gaunt bird seeking with its
lengthy beak for any meagre grain which might chance in
its way. Somehow one felt the grain he sought must be
meagre. 'The good God wills that Forstner lives,' said
Madame de Ruth, 'and God knows he lives according to
God's rules; but oh! how more than usually tiresome he
makes those rules, poor Bony One!'</p>

<p>Forstner naturally disapproved of Wilhelmine, and the two
were for ever contradicting each other; but she often endeavoured
to propitiate him, for she loathed disapproval, and
preferred the open hostility of a real enemy to the presence of
any merely disapproving person. Eberhard Ludwig suffered
intensely in those weeks at Stuttgart; he was fiercely irritable
to Forstner, resenting his comments on Wilhelmine, though
he longed childishly for some appreciation of a new and much-prized
toy.</p>

<p>Stafforth, who had returned with the Duke, assisted the
intrigue to the best of his ability by constantly arranging
meetings, feasts, picnics in the forest, music in the evenings,
followed by gay suppers. But he offended Wilhelmine deeply,
though she gave no sign thereof, for he treated the whole situa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>tion
as an ordinary court intrigue, which indeed it was, though
both people concerned were earnestly and deeply engaged in
the one great love of their lives. Forstner sat like a grim,
polite skeleton at these feasts, and Wilhelmine grew to hate
him in those summer days. Her hatred was destined to
wreak a terrible vengeance against him. Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz
had also returned to Stuttgart, leaving his wife in Rottenburg
awaiting the birth of their first child.</p>

<p>Duchess Johanna Elizabetha continued to reside at the
castle, torturing herself with jealous fears. She appeared
before the Duke with eyes reddened by sleepless nights and
bitter tears, and her habitual dreariness of being was doubled.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig himself, intent upon his love, gave the
poor woman scarce a thought, though when he saw her he noted
her tear-stained eyelids and her woebegone, reproachful ways
with an irritation which, though it could not pierce the studied
courtesy of his manner, made itself felt, and further wounded
the unhappy woman. Madame de Stafforth was constantly
with the Duchess, and thus her Highness was perfectly informed
of the Duke's daily visits at the Stafforth house.</p>

<p>The days dragged on, and the heat grew to be almost unbearable.
Each day the sun shone more gloriously, and the
Duchess longed for one grey, overcast day. To her the sun
seemed pitiless and cruel, the summer's amplitude seemed to
mock her in her misery.</p>

<p>Each evening, at set of sun, she heard the rattle and rumble
of Eberhard Ludwig's coach, which he drove himself with
eight magnificent spirited horses. True, his Highness never
failed to send his consort a courteous invitation to join the
feast at some Jagd Schloss in the forest; but she invariably
refused, alleging that she was weary, that her head ached, or
that she would fain rest, for she guessed that Wilhelmine
would be there.</p>

<p>Unrest was in Wilhelmine's heart also. She still held
back from giving herself to Eberhard Ludwig, and the future
seemed to her dark and difficult. She knew she loved his
Highness, but both her sincere love and her indomitable
pride revolted at the thought of becoming a mere toy, a
mistress to be thrown aside whenever the Duke's whim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
dictated. A thousand times she told herself that this would
never happen, that Eberhard Ludwig loved her with a true
and lasting passion, yet a wave of haughty doubt swept over
her and kept her back. One day it was announced from the
castle that her Highness had commanded a famous troupe of
Italian musicians to perform a series of madrigals before the
court. The Duchess caused a summons to be issued to
members of the court at Stuttgart, adding, however, that no
foreign visitors could be invited, the concert being strictly
private. This was a direct insult to Wilhelmine, for she was
the only foreign visitor in Stuttgart. Stafforth announced
this news to his Highness, Madame de Ruth, and Wilhelmine
as they sat at supper beneath the beech-tree in the Stafforth
garden. A silence fell upon the party. Madame de Ruth
leaned back in her chair, fanning herself gently; Eberhard
Ludwig turned to Wilhelmine, his face had flushed deeply,
and it was with an unsteady voice that he said:</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle, I formally invite you to hear the music to-morrow
evening at my castle of Stuttgart. Her Highness,
my honoured wife, will gladly make an exception in her
arrangements for so famous a musician as yourself.'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' broke in Stafforth hurriedly, 'I fear your
Highness cannot&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig silenced him with a look, and turning to
Wilhelmine he said, almost sternly: 'I await the honour,
Mademoiselle, of your answer, which I shall carry myself to
her Highness.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine rose.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' she said, and her voice had a ring which
caused Madame de Ruth to start,&mdash;'Monseigneur, I can refuse
you nothing. To-morrow I will do as you desire.' The rich
blood mantled to her cheeks. Eberhard Ludwig caught her
hand; raising it to his lips he murmured 'To-morrow!' and
turning quickly left the garden with hasty strides. Wilhelmine
walked away down the garden-path, desiring apparently to
commune with herself. Stafforth remained standing. Observing
Madame de Ruth, who was laughing quietly to herself&mdash;</p>

<p>'Madame,' he said angrily, 'I see nothing to laugh at!
This will be going too far. It is an insult to her Highness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
and we shall have the whole court against us! She must
<i>not</i> go to this madrigal singing, I tell you!'</p>

<p>'Dear friend,' Madame answered, 'I am not laughing at
that. I laugh because I see once more that a man may
plead till his heart breaks, it is when a woman sees another
woman absolutely denied for her sake, that she knows she is
loved as she approves; <i>then</i> she capitulates and whispers&mdash;to-morrow!'
The old woman laughed again.</p>

<p>'Well, Madame!' replied Stafforth, 'you will see what this
"to-morrow" means!'</p>

<hr />

<p>The Italian musicians were grouped together at one end of
her Highness's own reception-room in the castle of Stuttgart.
The invited audience was small, for only such ladies and
gentlemen as were actually obliged, by the holding of important
court charges, remained in the town during the hot summer
months; thus it had been deemed more fitting for the
madrigals to be performed in the castle itself instead of in
the fine hall of the Lusthaus where the court festivities usually
took place. Her Highness's reception-room gave out on to
the Renaissance gallery of the inner courtyard. The room
was hung with sombre tapestries heavy with the dust of
centuries; a number of waxen tapers flamed in silver candlesticks;
rows of seats were arranged in a half-circle behind the
high gilt chairs placed for his Highness Eberhard Ludwig
and his consort her Highness Johanna Elizabetha.</p>

<p>The musicians turned over the leaves of the manuscript
music on the desks before them; sometimes the sound of a
violin chord, struck to prove its correctness, broke on the air.
The swish of silken skirts on the wooden floor of the gallery
without announced the advent of the first guests, and gradually
the room was filled by richly clad ladies and finely
attired gentlemen.</p>

<p>The appointed hour was long passed for the music's
commencement, but neither the Duke nor the Duchess had
left their apartments, and the courtiers whispered that their
Highnesses were closeted together, and that angry voices had
been heard by one of the pages attendant in the antehall.
The clock of the Stiftskirche tolled out nine strokes, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
courtiers murmured angrily that they had been waiting an
entire hour.</p>

<p>At length the door leading to her Highness's apartment
was flung open, and Monsieur de Gemmingen, Controller of
the Duchess's household, appeared, bowing deeply as Johanna
Elizabetha entered, followed by Madame de Stafforth, who was
in attendance on her Highness in the absence of Mademoiselle
de M&uuml;nsingen, the lady-in-waiting. The audience rose to
greet the Duchess, and at that moment his Highness Eberhard
Ludwig appeared from another door followed by Oberhofmarshall
Stafforth, Reischach, and other gentlemen of the
suite.</p>

<p>Her Highness bowed to right and left. Her face was deadly
white and her eyes swollen with weeping; even her usual
colourless amiability seemed to have deserted her, for, after
the generally inclusive salute to the entire company, she
swept towards her gilded chair without a word of direct
greeting to any individual. Eberhard Ludwig, on the contrary,
assumed an air of gaiety, as with his habitual grace of
manner he passed down the lines of guests, finding a courteous
word for each and all. Yet the courtiers remarked that his
Highness's face was flushed, and that his eyes held a glitter
of angry defiance; but he gave no other sign of disturbance,
and did not respond to Stafforth's whispered inquiry if his
Highness had heard news of serious import.</p>

<p>Johanna Elizabetha summoned the Oberhofmarshall and
desired him to command the musicians to commence, and the
courtiers watched how Eberhard Ludwig, seating himself
beside her Highness, seemed to fix his mind upon the music.
It was a matter of comment that Monsieur and Madame de
Stafforth were present at the concert without their guest
Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz; and the well informed, delighted
with their superior knowledge, whispered that the decree 'No
Foreigners' was levelled at this lady alone. Under cover
of the music the audience gossiped in whispers, while they
noted the Duchess Johanna Elizabetha's demeanour with
interest.</p>

<p>Her Highness sat beside the Duke in that attitude which,
translated from court to market-place parlance, would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
been 'turning her back upon him'; in more polite circles
this attitude becomes a mere inclination of the shoulder. It
is less satisfactory to the offended, though certainly not less
abashing to the offender, than the ruder, more frankly human
market-place manner. And it seemed as though his Highness
felt it to be so, for he repeatedly endeavoured to address his
spouse over this battlemented shoulder; but her Highness
answered shortly, if at all, and the shoulder became each time
more aggressively pointed.</p>

<p>The musicians meanwhile performed a series of madrigals
accompanied by viole d'amore, violins, and viole da gamba.
The candles flickered in the draught from the open windows.
Madame de Ruth sat resignedly beside Monseigneur de
Zollern, whose fine head had dropped forward on his breast.
He was asleep; and Madame de Ruth realised, with a sigh, that
her beloved had grown old; that her youth had vanished too,
and even the joy of observing the tragi-comedy of human
nature palled for her at that moment, and she felt herself to
be old and lonely. At length the music ceased, and was
followed by that insolent, half-hearted applause which it is
the privilege of the truly cultured audience to offer to
musicians or actors.</p>

<p>Her Highness intimated her approval, and desired the
performers to rest a little after their exertions. At this
moment a door, directly to the left of her Highness's seat,
was flung open, and a bewildering vision of beauty stood
framed in the doorway. It was Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz,
the expressly excluded foreign visitor. Johanna Elizabetha
threw a glance towards this apparition and hastily averted
her eyes, her face flaming from throat to brow.</p>

<p>His Highness half rose from his seat, but sinking back he
endeavoured to attract the Duchess's attention to the late
arrival, who stood on the threshold awaiting her Highness's
greeting, without which it was impossible for her to join the
court circle, as having entered by the wrong door, she must
of necessity pass the Duchess in order to gain the ranks of
the audience. There was a moment of intense embarrassment;
Wilhelmine was as firmly fixed to her place in the
doorway as though nails had been fastened through her satin-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>slippered
feet to the boards beneath; for etiquette forbade
her to advance without her Highness's greeting, and fear of
ridicule barred her way back through the door. The Duchess
remained immovable, her eyes upon the group of musicians;
the Duke endeavoured nervously to draw her Highness's
attention to Wilhelmine; the audience had fallen into one
of those painful silences, with which an assembly invariably
adds to the awkward moments of social life. Partly it is
that curiosity rules all men and most women; partly that,
however cultured and refined the individuals may be, a <i>mass</i>
of human beings is like some wild animal&mdash;awkward, ungainly,
horribly cruel, ready to gloat over the discomfiture of friend
or foe.</p>

<p>The flickering of the candles in the silver candlesticks
seemed to become a noisy flaring, and through the large
room the falling of a waxen flake on the polished table rang
out distinctly; the string of a violin broke, and it sounded
like a pistol-shot in the stillness. Her Highness remained
unmoved, with eyes fixed upon the musicians. The tension
was almost intolerable. The victory seemed to belong to the
stern hostess, and yet it was upon Wilhelmine standing in
the doorway that every eye was fixed. She stood perfectly
motionless, one hand upon the lintel of the door, the other
holding her fan; her head was poised imperiously, chin tilted
as when she sang; her lips were parted in a half-smile, and
her eyes were fixed upon her Highness with her strange
compelling look. Was the Duchess victorious? surely not&mdash;the
homage of the whole company was to the beauty of the
woman on the threshold.</p>

<p>At length the Duke, in desperation, boldly touched her
Highness's shoulder. 'Your Highness has not observed your
Highness's newly appointed lady-in-waiting!'</p>

<p>He spoke so clearly that the audience heard each carefully
pronounced syllable.</p>

<p>'Your Highness will remember summoning Mademoiselle
de Gr&auml;venitz to attend upon your Highness this evening for
the first time in her new capacity?'</p>

<p>Johanna Elizabetha turned. For a tick of the clock she
deliberately measured her adversary with her protuberant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
eyes, then slowly she bent her head in formal greeting. Wilhelmine
stepped forward, then sank to the ground in the
elaborate court courtesy; rising, she walked a few steps, and
again swept her Highness the usual obeisance, and calmly
assumed her appointed place as lady-in-waiting behind the
Duchess's chair.</p>

<p>The musicians recommenced to play; her Highness stared
stonily before her; the Duke leaned back drumming with
nervous fingers on the gilt arm of his chair; the audience
murmured together conjectures and remarks. Wilhelmine
was almost as motionless as her Highness; her eyes were
fixed upon the musicians, and her face was inscrutable.
The concert came to an end, and the Duchess rose; she turned
towards Madame de Stafforth, summoning her as lady-in-waiting-extraordinary
to accompany her, thereby entirely
ignoring Wilhelmine, the newly appointed lady-in-waiting,
whose office it should have been to attend her Highness.
After saluting her guests collectively by one sweeping
courtesy, Johanna Elizabetha walked towards her apartments.
Eberhard Ludwig made a movement forward as though to
stay the Duchess; but he stopped short, and turned to Wilhelmine,
who was standing behind the Duchess's empty chair,
uncertain whether to follow her Highness or no.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz,' he said, 'the Duchess is
evidently indisposed, and thus will not be present at the
supper this evening, therefore I take it your services as lady-in-waiting
will be dispensed with. May I have the honour
of leading you to supper?' and he offered Wilhelmine his
hand in the graceful fashion of those days. The last thing
her Highness Johanna Elizabetha saw, as once more she paused
to bow from the doorway to her guests, was the Duke leading
her new lady-in-waiting towards the supper-room.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Duchess Johanna Elizabetha's guests were leaving the
castle: a constant stream of coaches drew up, one by one, in
the courtyard, and having taken up their owners rumbled away
through the heavy archway and across the moat towards the
town. Only Oberhofmarshall Stafforth, Madame de Ruth, his
Grace of Zollern, and Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz lingered in the supper-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>room
by his Highness's command. Stafforth was anxious and
silent; Zollern sleepy; the voluble Madame de Ruth was
talking rapidly, with the evident intention of making the
scene appear unimportant to the flunkeys in attendance.
Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz said nothing, but looked pompous, and
drank ostentatiously with rounded forearm, showing off his
fine muscles, in spite of the fact that no one paid any heed
to him. He had been invaluable during supper itself, for he
had roared out stories, under cover of whose noise those who
had real things to discuss had been enabled to talk, while the
outsiders imagined that his Highness's circle listened to the
Kammerjunker. But now he had been silenced by a peremptory
word from the Duke, and he was thus relegated to
the position of onlooker, though, in truth, he evidently believed
all eyes to be upon him, for he looked sulkily self-conscious
and perfectly foolish.</p>

<p>At one of the windows stood Eberhard Ludwig, beside him
Wilhelmine. They were speaking together in an undertone.
Madame de Ruth sometimes cast an anxious glance towards
them. She wished the conversation would end; already the
servants must have made comment upon so long an interview,
and though the opinion of menials was a matter of little importance,
the wily dame did not desire Wilhelmine's business
to become the talk of the town until the intrigue was fully
developed.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' she whispered to Monsieur de Zollern, 'this
must end. Believe me, her Highness has many virtue-loving
spies who will report to her with the exaggeration of the
respectable foul-minded, and we shall be accused of having
had a nocturnal carousal.'</p>

<p>Monsieur de Zollern rose and hobbled across to the pair at
the window. He had just reached them when the door opened,
and Baron Forstner appeared on the threshold.</p>

<p>'Ah! Serenissimus!' exclaimed Zollern, 'that is indeed
an excellent story! Your Highness must pardon an old
invalid if he retires with the memory of that witty tale in
his mind as a bonne bouche.' He bowed and took his leave,
while Forstner, who had arrived on the scene hoping to find
the lovers alone together, was entirely put off the scent;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
Zollern's quick ruse having made it appear as though the
conversation had been general.</p>

<p>The company now took leave, Zollern offering Forstner a
seat in his coach, which was accepted; thus the 'Representative
of all the virtues' (another of Madame de Ruth's names
for 'L'osseux') was safely removed from the scene, leaving
Kammerjunker Gr&auml;venitz to attend his Highness. Madame
de Ruth retired to her rooms in the castle. Stafforth escorted
Wilhelmine to his coach, which waited to convey her to the
house in the Graben. As he bowed gallantly over her hand
he felt her fingers press a paper into his palm. She must
have penned it ere she came to the concert, he reflected, for
she could have found no opportunity for writing since. When
he reached the deserted corridor outside the antehall, where
two tall gentlemen-at-arms guarded the door of his Highness's
sleeping apartment, he held the missive up to the light of one
of the flickering wall-lamps: 'For his Highness's own hand
alone,' he read.</p>

<p>'Ah&mdash;&mdash;!' he murmured. Passing through the antehall,
he gained admission to Eberhard Ludwig's apartment.</p>

<p>'Stafforth, my friend!' cried the Duke, when the Oberhofmarshall
appeared, 'this is much courtesy,&mdash;you attend me
with zeal!' and he laughed gaily.</p>

<p>Stafforth looked fixedly at him; he wished to convey to his
Highness his desire to speak with him alone; but Friedrich
Gr&auml;venitz also, unfortunately, had this impression, and being
at once the most suspicious and the most tactless of mortals,
he had evidently made up his mind to remain in attendance,
as was indeed officially correct, though it was usual for the
subordinate official to retire courteously when a person holding
a superior court charge was present at the Duke's disrobing.
It was impossible for Stafforth to give his Highness Wilhelmine's
missive in her brother's presence, for the conspirators
had long discovered that Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz either lost his
temper and blustered, if he felt himself excluded from full
knowledge of anything concerning his sister's affairs; or else,
were he taken into their confidence, he compromised the
situation by some gross tactlessness the which he himself
considered, and represented, to be a master-stroke of diplomacy<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
After some moments' conversation, Stafforth hit on a plan.
He walked across the room and leaned out of the open window.
'What a glorious night!' he exclaimed. 'Ah, Monseigneur!
I understand your Highness's love for the silent woods at
night; even here, in the town, the summer night is full of
mysterious poetry! Gr&auml;venitz, if his Highness permit you,
come and look at the beauty of the far-off stars. You also
have a vein of poetry in your soldier-nature.' This being
exactly what Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz entirely lacked, it flattered
him extremely to be credited with the quality. He craved
his Highness's permission to look at the glorious night scenery,
and repairing to the window leaned out beside Stafforth. The
Oberhofmarshall immediately pressed close against him and
encircled his shoulders with one arm, holding the dupe firmly
away from the interior of the room; meanwhile Stafforth's other
arm was round his own back, with Wilhelmine's letter held out
in that hand towards the Duke. He remained thus expatiating
on the beauty of the night, till he felt the Duke withdraw
the missive from him. Having assured himself by hearing
a faint rustle of paper that Eberhard Ludwig had read the
missive, he finished his oration, and removed his strong arm
from Gr&auml;venitz's shoulder.</p>

<p>Now it was the Duke who leaned out of the window. 'O
Stafforth!' he cried, 'the night is too beautiful to sleep
through! Gentlemen, I invite you to hunt with me to-morrow
at break of day! We will meet at the edge of the Rothwald
and follow the stag. Till dawn, then, farewell! I shall
wander in the wood till then.'</p>

<p>His Highness dismissed Stafforth and Gr&auml;venitz. As the
door closed upon the two courtiers, Eberhard Ludwig snatched
a crumpled paper from his breast. It was the Duchess
Johanna Elizabetha's formal command to her guests to appear
at her private concert of madrigals:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE GHETTO</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> new lady-in-waiting was installed in two rooms in the
castle, very near the roof and hard by Madame de Ruth's
apartment. Wilhelmine received a small income, also her
food and the services of a waiting-woman of the ducal
household. This person was a large, fair-skinned Swabian&mdash;a
peasant, simple yet suspicious, loud-voiced, rough in
manner, very tender of heart. During the first days of her
service she feared and disliked her 'foreign' mistress, but,
like every one whom Wilhelmine chose to charm, Maria
adored her before the week was out with that whole-hearted
devotion which servants sometimes give their employers, and
which is often so unequal a bargain. But it was not to prove
so in this case, for Wilhelmine responded readily to any
genuine affection, and, proud as she was, she was too proud to
imagine that her freedom of speech and her easy laughter
could be met with undue familiarity, which indeed, as is usual
with the woman of true breeding, it never was. Maria
remained devoted and free spoken, though absolutely respectful.
To her the 'Gr&auml;venitzin,' as people began to call
Wilhelmine, poured out the story of the numerous petty
annoyances which disturbed her, and the peasant girl learned
to regard her as a persecuted angel. Though her mistress's
violent temper flamed forth if the smallest detail of the toilet
went amiss, and often, indeed, for no apparent cause, the next
moment the impression was erased and the waiting-maid's
heart soothed by some affectionate word or hasty, almost
childlike, apology. Few know the extraordinary loyalty, the
silence and forbearing, which many servants exercise; but
those who do, and can prize it truly, have an added power in
their hands and an immense aid to their ambition. Maria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
while absolutely silent regarding her mistress's affairs, was
fully informed concerning the rest of the inhabitants of the
Stuttgart castle and of their various opinions of Wilhelmine,
and all this she communicated while the latter lay abed
drinking her chocolate of a morning. In this manner
Wilhelmine learned many things of which she would otherwise
have been ignorant.</p>

<p>One morning, about a month after the commencement of
Wilhelmine's sojourn at the castle, she was dressing at her
leisure, her Highness having commanded her presence at a
later hour than usual. The window stood open, and she
could hear the whirl of wings as the doves flew about
from the roof of the inner courtyard or alighted on the
stone balustrade below her window. The heat had abated,
and a faint sighing breeze was wafted through the window.
Maria had gone to the town to purchase a ribbon for Madame
de Ruth's spaniel, and the Gr&auml;venitzin remained alone. She
leaned back in a tall, carved chair, listening to the million
sounds of silence. Ah! Silence!&mdash;quiet! how she loved it!
With yearning she realised how she longed for the stillness
of some deep wood or of some fragrant garden, with Eberhard
Ludwig at her side. True, she saw him daily at court; drove
with him on his fine coach drawn by eight horses; supped
with him, sang to him, knew herself to be his acknowledged
mistress. There were stolen interviews in her little room,
moments of wondrous rapture and thrilling, passionate surrender.
Yet, somehow, she never had the sensation of being
entirely undisturbed, of enjoying the delight of solitude with
him, safe from possible interruption. She knew that her
genuine passion for the Duke was regarded by the court as
an ordinary gallant adventure; her relation with him classed
among the unlovely liaisons of princes; and, like each woman
who considers her personal conduct, she imagined her own
love to be a thing utterly different to the passions of other
women&mdash;infinitely purer, absolutely apart. Also, she hated
disapproval; it had the power to vilify her, drawing out the
worst in her nature. Then the Duchess, who was possessed
of all the harsh cruelty of the untempted virtuous woman,
constantly slighted the lady-in-waiting, whose presence she,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
perforce, endured, while it afforded her a decided relief to vent
her jealous, agonised spleen in the privacy of her apartment
upon her victorious rival of public society. She little knew,
poor soul, what a sinister list of 'affronts to be avenged' was
being written in Wilhelmine's mind, nor could she gauge, she
of the moth-coloured spite, the evil, relentless hatred which
she was daily fostering in a heart strong to love and strong
to hate.</p>

<p>Even Madame de Ruth was appalled at the dimensions of
the affair which she herself had aided in creating. Wilhelmine
fascinated her still, but she began to fear her, and though she
laughed at those who murmured that 'the Gr&auml;venitzin had the
evil eye,' a certain disquiet peeped into her mind at times.
Wilhelmine had heard, through the maid Maria, that there
were whispers of her being possessed of the evil eye; and it
amused her to confront those who offended or irritated her
with that strange look which she could command at will.
Certainly she had a vast will-power, and the Duke was
subjugated, not alone by love but by that marvellous
dominion of mind which is exercised by certain beings over
others. He told her often that she was a witch; being doubly
a poet since he loved, he raved of the witchery of his mistress;
yet had he dreamed for one moment that there could be anything
mysterious in her fascination he would have been
appalled. He was of his day, and could not explain glibly the
mysteries and marvels of personal attraction and repulsion, of
will-power and dominion, by the easy word magnetism. He
would have called it 'witchcraft, magic, devilry,' and he did
later on, and trembled. But all this was only beginning when
Wilhelmine sat listening to the silence that summer morning.
A heavy footfall on the balcony without aroused her from her
reverie, and her window was darkened for a flash by a passing
form. A rough knock came on her door, and she heard a voice
informing her the Altesse S&eacute;r&eacute;nissime the Duchess desired her
presence immediately.</p>

<p>She sprang up. 'Tell her Highness I will come immediately;
but that, as I was not commanded for so early an
hour, I am unfortunately not quite ready,' she called after the
lackey's retreating form. She flung off her morning gown and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
began hastily to don a silken bodice, but it took her longer to
dress without Maria's help, and it was some time before she
stood at the door of her Highness's anteroom. She was met
by one of the tiring-women whom she particularly disliked,
and whose mulish face and impertinent manners had often
irritated her.</p>

<p>'Her Highness is waiting, Fr&auml;uleinle von Gr&auml;venitz,' said
this person, while she treated Wilhelmine to an insolent stare.</p>

<p>'That has nothing to do with you,' answered Wilhelmine
haughtily, her ready anger flaring at the covert insolence of
the woman's manner and the familiar use of the word
'Fr&auml;uleinle.' As she passed she caught a grin of amusement
on the woman's face. Ridicule from any one, but especially
from the 'canaille,' as she termed most of the inmates of this
world, was a thing which always raised the slumbering devil
in Wilhelmine. She turned abruptly, confronting the tiring-woman
with that fixed evil glance of hers. The smile died
on the woman's lips, and she shrank back muttering.</p>

<p>'You will regret your insolence,' said Wilhelmine, thereby
forging another link in that chain of the witchcraft theory
which was destined to have such strange developments in her
life and fate.</p>

<p>'I am accustomed to being attended immediately, Mademoiselle,
when I send for my ladies,' said the Duchess icily as
Wilhelmine entered.</p>

<p>'Your Highness will pardon me; it was an unexpected
summons, and I was not dressed.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I suppose the so evidently recent attack of smallpox
makes Mademoiselle a little delicate still?' replied Johanna
Elizabetha, with a spiteful smile, and looking pointedly at her
lady-in-waiting's face.</p>

<p>At this taunt, once more, though this time involuntarily,
the snake look came into Wilhelmine's eyes. Her Highness
did not shrink, but returned the gaze fully with a glance of
quiet animosity. Johanna Elizabetha was a brave woman,
of good blood, and it is remarkable that, through all her
dealings with the Gr&auml;venitz, she never showed any of that
fear, which to arouse was one of this mysterious woman's
most potent weapons. 'Would it please you were I to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>
you permission to retire from court for a few months,
Mademoiselle, in order to recoup your damaged&mdash;er&mdash;health?'
She paused before the last word, and her adversary knew
what she would have said. The lady-in-waiting still had the
strength to command the wave of bitter anger which was
surging within her, and she answered calmly:</p>

<p>'I thank your Highness for the offer; but,' here a note of
insolent triumph pierced through the studied courtesy of her
manner, 'but I find the climate of Stuttgart agrees vastly
well with me, and I need no change. Your Highness must
remember how much I am in the open air.'</p>

<p>This allusion to the constant drives with Eberhard Ludwig
goaded Johanna Elizabetha past endurance.</p>

<p>'You will not be able to be abroad so much in future,
Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz,' she answered grimly; 'I intend
to commence a large piece of embroidery, and the work will
keep me more in the house. I shall require your services to
read to me while I am working.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine bowed.</p>

<p>'Fetch me that embroidery frame and the silks, Mademoiselle,'
the Duchess said, in a tone of such imperious command
that the other felt an angry blush flame in her cheeks; but she
walked quietly across the room and brought the frame to her
Highness, who at once busied herself in matching the coloured
silks on the design. Seating herself near the window, and
settling the frame on a small table before her, she worked
steadily for some time in silence, Wilhelmine standing near,
not having been granted permission to be seated. The silence
became horrible, tense, gloomy; the air seemed quivering with
the hatred which both women felt. At length the Duchess
laid aside her work and, turning, faced her lady-in-waiting
directly.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz,' she said slowly,
'I will give you one chance of becoming an honest woman.
You are unnecessary to me in your present capacity, and
I have decided to remove you from my service.' She rose
with the dignity she could assume at times. 'The reasons for
my decision you know well enough, and, indeed, it were not
fitting for me to discuss them with you. If you will resign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
your charge, and leave the country to-day, promising never to
return, I will announce that, to my regret, you have been
called back to your home. As I know you came here penniless,
I offer you a free present of ten thousand gulden, under
the conditions I have named. If you will not accept this I
shall have you driven from my house, and I shall command
that no one in Wirtemberg shall shelter you under pain of loss
of entry at court.'</p>

<p>Johanna Elizabetha was really impressive and dignified,
infinitely pathetic too; for it was a futile assumption of an
authority hers by right, and, in fact, absolutely non-existent.
'I await your answer,' she added, a little tremulously.</p>

<p>'And I give you my answer, here and now, for to-day and
for as long as I choose. And my answer is&mdash;No!' She said
it boldly, but her heart was beating violently; after all, she
too was fighting for her life, for all she had found beautiful,
for the man she loved, and for the ease and charm of existence,
the 'fine linen and fair raiment, honour and power,'
without which she could and would not live.</p>

<p>The Duchess looked at her curiously. Certainly she was
very beautiful, standing straight, tall, and strong; radiant with
health, magnificent in her proud decision of being; with head
thrown back, hands clasped behind her like a child saying a
lesson&mdash;the singing attitude, which the Duchess had often seen
before with angry, grudging admiration.</p>

<p>'Is this your decision?' Johanna Elizabetha asked once
more. 'God in Heaven! why did you come here? I offer
you wealth and peace; cannot you go and leave me what is
mine?'</p>

<p>'Yours?' broke out Wilhelmine impetuously. 'Yours?
You know what you say is untrue! Yours!'</p>

<p>Such an accent of scorn, such an intolerable ridicule of the
unbeautiful woman lay in Wilhelmine's voice, that the Duchess
drew back as from a blow; she shrank, feeling herself thrust
into the chill dreariness of the world of unloved, unlovable,
undesired, undesirable women. Then the pride of race reasserted
itself; after all, she was the mistress, and this, her
tormentor, was her servant. For once, goaded out of her
measured correctness, the Duchess became vital, vehement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
agonisedly energetic and passionate. She swept past Wilhelmine
to the door of her apartment; she flung it open, and
called loudly to the sentry who stood below in the courtyard,
bidding him summon the captain of the guard and a detachment
of men-at-arms. The man's hurried steps rang out as
he clattered across the courtyard. Then the silence was only
broken by the heavy breathing of the maddened woman at
the door, and once more Wilhelmine heard the swish and
whirl of the wings as the doves flew about the balustrade.
Then came the even tramp of men, and a captain of the guard,
with drawn sword, stood in the doorway before her Highness,
the yellow and silver of the men's uniforms making a picture
of gay colours framed in the grey stonework of the balcony
beyond.</p>

<p>'Remove that woman! She has insulted me! Take her
across the moat, and close the castle door upon her. She
shall not enter here again!' The Duchess's voice came short
and sharp.</p>

<p>'But, your Highness&mdash;&mdash;' began the captain.</p>

<p>'Do as I command!' broke in Johanna Elizabetha; and
never had man or woman heard the 'Dull Duchess' speak in
so proud a tone.</p>

<p>The captain approached Wilhelmine; he feared her and
dreaded the Duke's indignation.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz,' he said hesitatingly, 'I must
obey; believe me, I do not understand&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nor need you,' answered Wilhelmine haughtily; 'I am
ready to follow you. Your Highness,' and she bent in the
usual courtesy; but the poor Duchess could not see it, for she
had hidden her face in her hands, and, with convulsive sobs,
she wept in a painful reaction of weakness after her outburst
of passionate decision.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wilhelmine found herself standing beyond the moat, with
the iron gate leading to the castle courtyard grimly closed
upon her. It was a perplexing moment; she knew not
whither she might seek shelter, and she wished to avoid
scandal as far as possible. The Duke had gone to Urach to
inspect the coverts for the autumn hunting, and he would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
return for several days. Madame de Ruth was in the castle,
unconscious of the stirring events of the morning. Stafforth
had accompanied the Duke, and she knew Madame de Stafforth
would not receive her if she made known the cause of her
departure from the castle. She realised, with dismay, that
when she went to the Duchess she had, naturally, not taken
money with her, so that she could not even seek the shelter of
an inn. It was an awkward predicament, and yet so ridiculous
to this woman, certain of the Duke-ruler's homage, that she
laughed gently to herself as she walked slowly away through
the castle gardens towards the town. The air was still and
heavy, and the sound of cries and traffic from the market-place
came to her distinctly. To her right lay the Duke's J&auml;gerhaus
and the kennels, from whence came an occasional bark from
some of Eberhard Ludwig's numerous hounds.</p>

<p>Where should she go? The question was becoming urgent,
for the heat of midday approached and already her head ached
dully. She walked on, hardly noticing that she had passed
beyond the garden gate, and it was with a start that she
suddenly realised she had wandered to an unfamiliar part of
the town. She was in a narrow street, where the overhanging
higher stories of the houses approached each other so
closely that the sky between them seemed to be but a distant
blue streak. Instinctively she had turned into this shaded
gangway to escape from the burning sun. To her horror she
felt a curious weakness creeping over her, a booming sounded
in her ears, and the veins of her throat seemed to have swelled
as though the blood would burst through the skin. She put
up her hand to the velvet ribbon which she wore round her
neck, and her fingers pulled awkwardly, impatiently, impotently
at it. She felt as if her eyeballs were pushed
violently outwards by clumsy, heavy finger-tips. She leaned
against the wall of one of the houses, and, with the idea of
avoidance of scandal still working numbly in her brain, she
turned her head this way and that to see if there were any
observers of her pitiful plight; but the street lay to right and
left, sordid, silent, and deserted. She reflected that, of course,
the inhabitants must be sheltering from the heat&mdash;sleeping,
perhaps&mdash;Ah! sleeping!&mdash;and she was so tired, so deathly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
weary&mdash;and her feet were so heavy&mdash;so far away&mdash;and
heavy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Surely Monsieur Gabriel would be pleased with that
melody? Wilhelmine turned towards him, then half-consciousness
returning told her she was not in G&uuml;strow. Where
was she? She moved, tried to sit up; on her brow a hand,
cool and soothing, pressed her backwards, closing her aching
eyes. Once more her thoughts sank downwards&mdash;flickered,
as it were. What did it signify where she was, after all?
Everything was far off. What scent was that? Wonderful!
She drew it in to her lungs, and it seemed to fill her breast
with fragrant freshness. With a sigh, she came back from
some dim world and opened her eyes. A strange face bent
over her and she stared wonderingly at it. Surely she was
dreaming still, for it was the face of a picture she knew.
Remembrance came, ere full consciousness grasped sway of her&mdash;Savonarola,
the Monk of San Marco. She had seen a wood-cut
portrait of the inspired fanatic in a book of Eberhard
Ludwig's library. She lay, scarcely returned from her unconsciousness,
gazing at this face. Yes, Savonarola! The powerful,
broken brow, the small, piercing eyes, the rugged cheeks, the
whole face dominated by the huge nose. Then full consciousness
returned to her, and she saw that this was no fanatic genius, no
monk of Italy, but an old woman with an extraordinary physiognomy,
who was watching her with patient, kindly eyes.
Wilhelmine sat up, pushing from her brow a cloth soaked
in some essence, from whence came the delicious pungent
scent which had recalled her from her trance.</p>

<p>'Where am I?' she asked.</p>

<p>'You are safe, and, I pray you, rest,' answered a hoarse,
weak voice.</p>

<p>'I thank you,' Wilhelmine said, 'I will rest; but, at least,
tell me where I am and who you are?'</p>

<p>'I am the widow of Ishakar Ben Hazzim, and you fainted
at my door, so I took you in.'</p>

<p>'A very Christian action from a Jew, and I thank you,'
replied Wilhelmine haughtily. All the unreasoning hatred of
the Jewish race lay in her withdrawal from even ordinary
gratitude towards the woman who had rescued her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
The face above her darkened, and the kind eyes changed to
flickering pin-points of anger.</p>

<p>'Christian? Nay, girl; it is Christian to be cruel!
Christian? God of my fathers! it is Christian to murder and
oppress! Did you not hear that I told you I am the widow
of Ishakar Ben Hazzim, the son of Israel? and in my house,
when I have anointed your head with rare essences to cool
you from your sun-faint, you insult me, and you owe me
no affront!' There was a pride in the woman's manner
which appealed to Wilhelmine.</p>

<p>'Indeed, I meant none, and I thank you for your courtesy,'
she said, and smiled.</p>

<p>'Well, rest you then,' replied the Jewess in a mollified tone;
and again silence fell between the two women.</p>

<p>'Why do Jews hate the Christians?' Wilhelmine asked,
after some time. She was interested, for this was a new and
surprising view; partly, too, she asked the question from lazy
curiosity.</p>

<p>'Hate them? Would not you?' returned the woman
harshly.</p>

<p>'Why should you?' the girl asked.</p>

<p>'Do you know anything of the story of our race, you who
ask? No? Well, I will tell you. For centuries we have
been outcasts, treated like beggars, like scum; for ages we
have suffered for the acts of our ancestors of hundreds of
generations past, and always the Christian has sought to
profit by our misfortunes; and have we been credulous of their
promises, they have returned us jibes and disdain.'</p>

<p>'But the Jews committed a terrible wrong,' Wilhelmine
interrupted; 'they crucified the&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Crucified! crucified!' broke in the Jewess angrily, 'we
are weary of the very word! We crucified Him as you
hang rebels, and He happened to be a Charmer who
inspired a new religion&mdash;yours! and for ever since you
Christians who rant of pardon, tenderness, moderation, love
of all the world&mdash;you have oppressed us with a vengeance
so terrible, so relentless, that we in our turn have learnt to
hate and contrive vengeance.'</p>

<p>'But can you?' Wilhelmine smiled mockingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
'Ah! but wait! Some day we, who have no heritage&mdash;we
shall inherit the earth!' The old Jewess's voice trailed, and
into its muttered tones thrilled the accent of the mystic
belief of race destiny which lives so strongly in the children of
Israel. Wilhelmine, upon whom no hint of power, of fate, or
of belief in the unknown, ever failed to work, listened with
growing interest. She questioned the old crone, and succeeded
in drawing from her a long and impassioned tirade upon the
wrongs of the race of Israel.</p>

<p>No one could charm people as could Wilhelmine; her
vitality, her sonorous voice, the quick sympathy which drew
confidences from the most reserved&mdash;in fine, her magnetic
force, made her, when she chose, the most irresistible of beings.
And she exerted herself to exercise her attraction upon the
Jewess, for her curiosity was thoroughly aroused, and also
with her strange instinct for power she scented a possible
use to her, if she could count upon the adherence of a silent,
secret force like the Jews. The old Jewess told how her
people were constantly in communication with their fellow
Jews of every land; she said that one who did a service to
a Jew was always sure of finding support from the whole race;
and Wilhelmine's quick brain and vivid imagination wove a
romantic web, herself the centre thereof, holding in one hand
the power of Wirtemberg's court, and in the other the secret
thread commanding the commercial enterprises undertaken
by freed and grateful Israelites. Romantic certainly, but
very lucrative to the heroine of this self-woven romance!</p>

<p>'Well, Widow Hazzim,' she said at length, 'destiny has
brought me to you. Some day I may have power to help
your race, will you vouch me gratitude and support in
return?' She spoke lightly, but her eyes were serious and
watchful, and her hands gripped the essence-soaked kerchief
which she had taken from her brow.</p>

<p>The Jewess laughed. 'Do us a service and you will see!'
she answered.</p>

<p>At this moment the door, which led to some inner room,
opened, and a boy appeared on the threshold.</p>

<p>'My great-nephew, lady,' said the Jewess; 'his mother is
my niece. He can sing like the heavenly seraphim, and great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
beauty of body is his as well.' She whispered the last statement
in that fatal whisper wherewith the aged often give
conceited self-consciousness to children.</p>

<p>The boy advanced: graceful, perfect in line, glowing in his
Jewish youthful beauty, which is usually over-bold, a trifle
insolent and hard. He approached Wilhelmine, and bent
before her in a salute so ceremonious that it was at once
strangely appealing from a child, and yet unctuous and
unnatural. Wilhelmine gave him her hand and inquired
his name.</p>

<p>'Joseph S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer, musician,' he replied gravely.</p>

<p>'Indeed? Musician!' she said, laughing. 'Thy profession
already fixed and entitled.'</p>

<p>'My father is a musician; he sings before courts, and I
shall do the same,' he added proudly.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine laughed. The boy's calm assurance of success
pleased her, and his unusual beauty attracted her, as all
personal comeliness invariably did.</p>

<p>'He knows what he wants, this Joseph S&uuml;ss,' she said;
'and to know what one wants, to know it decidedly, is the
first step to achievement. Grasp success firmly and it is
yours!'</p>

<p>The boy looked at her, fascinated by her loveliness,
dominated by her voice and the creed which she enunciated.
The old Jewess sent the boy to fetch his guitar, and when
he returned she desired him to sing for her guest's entertainment.</p>

<p>Joseph S&uuml;ss, with the too precocious manner of the Jewish
child, inquired with another elaborate bow if Wilhelmine
would care to hear his voice. She begged him to let her hear
the seraphim sing. The boy caught the note of irony in her
phrase; flushing deeply, he laid aside his guitar and would
have run away had not Wilhelmine, with her easy self-indulgent
kindness of heart to those who did not get in her way,
called him back and propitiated him with smiling reassurances.
The boy seated himself near her and sang. His voice was
deliciously fresh and clear, and Wilhelmine, delightedly, made
him sing again and again till the child's repertory was
exhausted. She praised him and fondled him, and taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
from her breast a small jewelled pin, engraved with her
initials, she fastened it in his coat.</p>

<p>'A remembrance, dear musician,' she said laughing. She
was destined to see that jewel again after long years, when
humiliation and defeat came to her, striking her down at the
zenith of her brilliant career.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>'SHE COMES TO STAY THIS TIME'</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Eberhard Ludwig</span> stood before his dull Duchess, his eyes fixed
on her heavy, handsome face with a look of such stern anger,
that the unhappy woman felt herself to be a criminal before
some harsh, implacable judge. The phrases she had prepared
in her mind during the two days since she had expelled her
rival from the castle faded away, and seemed to falter from
proud statements to a mere apology, an anxious pleading.</p>

<p>The Duke remained standing, one hand leant upon the back
of a chair, the other hung at his side, and Johanna Elizabetha
could see that his fingers were clenched and reclenched with
such force that the knuckles showed bluey white; otherwise
the man might have been made of stone and his eyes of
metal, so motionless and rigid was the whole figure. He had
entered her apartment, and had demanded in a voice of controlled
passion, deep with the effort he made to render it cold
and courteous, 'Madame, where is your Highness's lady-in-waiting?'</p>

<p>She met the question with a tremulous torrent of words.
'I have dismissed Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz. I required her
services no longer; she did not please me; she has left the
castle, probably the town. I do not know where she is.'</p>

<p>'I ask again, Madame la Duchesse, whither you have sent
Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz? You must have been aware of
her destination before you permitted a young lady to leave
the shelter of our castle,' he said. And the Duchess replied
by an angry outburst, a hailstorm of reproaches, before which
Eberhard Ludwig remained silent, cold, rigidly self-contained.
The Duchess paused; it was like beating one's hand against
some adamantine barrier. She had the sensation that all she
said, felt, suffered, passed unnoticed; the man before her was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
waiting for information, that was all. It was intolerable, and
the hopelessness of any pleading came to her.</p>

<p>'My husband,' she said in another tone, calm and cold as
his, 'I have endured enough. I have the right to dismiss my
lady-in-waiting if I think fit. I have done so, and the lady
will not enter my apartments again, nor will she be admitted
to any court festivities wherein I take part.' She turned
away; her despairing consciousness of ultimate humiliation
seemed to choke her, though her very defeat was transformed
to a moral victory by her resigned dignity. The Duke moved
forward. 'At least tell me what has occurred,' he said hurriedly.
'When I left you three days ago there was no word of any
dispute. I thought I left peace,' he added in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>The Duchess came towards him. She held out her hands in
a gesture of appeal: 'Eberhard, be just to me! I bore it as
long as I could, but that woman's presence was a daily torture
to me. Have a mistress, if need be,' this last bitterly,
'but at least do not cause her to be my companion. It is not
fitting.' The blood rushed to the Duke's face. 'Mademoiselle
de Gr&auml;venitz is fit to be the companion of saints, of angels!'
he retorted angrily. 'She will return to court, I warn your
Highness.' He turned abruptly and left the Duchess's apartment.</p>

<p>If the Duke, with the blindness of the enamoured, really
had imagined peace to reign in his palace prior to his sojourn at
Urach, on his return even love and anxiety could not hide the
excitement and unrest which the departure of the favourite
had caused in the castle of Stuttgart. Madame de Ruth, flinging
etiquette to the winds, had met his Highness in the courtyard
when he rode in from Urach, and had greeted him with
the news of Wilhelmine's flight. The good lady was genuinely
distressed, and had made unceasing search in the town, but
naturally no one had thought of seeking in the Judengasse
behind the Leonards Kirche. Wilhelmine seemed to have
vanished off the face of the earth, and there were not wanting
murmurers among the Duchess's servitors who averred that
witches had ever been able to vanish at will, and that probably
'the Gr&auml;venitzin' would return in the form of a black
cat or a serpent, and suddenly change into a woman again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
when it suited her. They were all in a flutter of superstitious
excitement; and Maria the maid, who loved Wilhelmine, went
about with reddened eyes, and was much questioned below
stairs.</p>

<p>The Duke, on hearing the news from Madame de Ruth, had
repaired immediately to the Duchess, but, as we have seen,
he had extracted no information from the lady, she having
none to give. When his Highness left the Duchess's apartment
he stormed up to Madame de Ruth's dwelling-room, and
after some deliberation summoned Forstner and charged him
with the unpleasant duty of leading a search party which was
supplied with a ducal warrant to enter all houses of every
grade in Stuttgart. Forstner, of course, urged patience; the
missing one would return or communicate, he said; but the
Duke greeted the word patience with such an outburst of
anger that the 'Bony One' retired discomfited and gave orders
for the search with apparent zeal.</p>

<p>Evening fell on the sun-baked streets of Stuttgart, and a
faint breeze wafted a recollection of field and wood through the
open windows of the castle. Eberhard Ludwig paced up and
down, near the fountain in the castle gardens, where he had
been with Wilhelmine on the moonlit night of the theatricals
three months ago. He flung himself down upon the stone
bench where they had sat together. He covered his eyes
with his hands, he was tortured with memories, thrilled again
to past raptures; his desire was aroused, increased a hundred-fold
by the anguish of absence. Could it be true that such
passion's enchantments were never to be his again? he asked
himself. His memory conjured up a thousand charms of
his beloved, her voice, her laugh, her touch. 'Wilhelmine,
Wilhelmine!'</p>

<p>He sprang up. 'God! it is awful! Wilhelmine, my love,
my mistress!' he said aloud. Ridiculous poet-fellow! he
listened as though he expected an answer.</p>

<p>In the distance there was a rumble of thunder, and the
restless breeze rioted suddenly in the tree-branches for a
moment, passed onward, then swept back again rustling, then
came a roll of thunder closer than the last. Another pause&mdash;fateful
it seemed, as though the garden trembled before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
coming storm. A white flash played intermittently upon
the fountain, followed by a thunderclap directly overhead, and
a torrent of rain poured down. The Duke stood still a
moment, the rain beating upon him. The storm delighted
him, it answered to his tempestuous mood. He turned
away from the castle and walked in the direction of the
garden boundary on the south side, passing the drawbridge
over the disused and flower-filled moat of the castle wall.
What would have been his emotions had he known that his
fancy led him to wander whither Wilhelmine had passed but
three days before? He came to the garden's limit and stood
looking towards the dimly discernible openings of several
narrow streets, the oldest and most ill-famed gangways of the
town. Of a sudden he descried a small form muffled in a
sombre cloak. The street was utterly deserted save for Eberhard
Ludwig himself and this forlorn little figure, and the
Duke's attention was thus arrested. The pouring rain had
not extinguished the light of the two dilapidated hanging
lamps, which were fixed upon the walls of the street from
whence had issued the diminutive night-wanderer, whom the
Duke saw was now making for the castle.</p>

<p>The true Wirtemberger vanishes like smoke before the first
drop of rain, and the Duke therefore concluded that any
errand undertaken, and continued, in a downpour must be for
a purpose of paramount importance. So he watched with
curiosity the approaching figure, observing with surprise that
it was a child of some ten years old.</p>

<p>'Ha, young person,' called the Duke, as the child reached
him; 'whither away so fast, and what may he want in the
castle gardens at this time of night?'</p>

<p>Thus apostrophised, the figure hesitated; then apparently
alarmed by the sight of the Duke's military cloak, and
probably taking him for a sentry or a garden guard, the child
ducked forward and would have made a bolt past his interrogator.
But the Duke, who was amused and half-suspicious of
the boy's errand, caught the figure by his heavy cloak, and
dragged him, a trifle roughly, under the light of the lantern
at the opposite street corner.</p>

<p>'Now he shall tell me where he was going,' Serenissimus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
said laughing. The disdainful use of the third person singular
seemed to anger the boy, who stood silent and sullen, with
bent head. 'But he <i>shall</i> tell me,' repeated the Duke,
enforcing his command by a rough shake.</p>

<p>'I will not tell you! What concern is it of yours?' the
boy replied at length.</p>

<p>The Duke bent a puzzled look upon his prisoner, whose
voice was refined, and whose German was guiltless of the rude
Swabian accent. He did not speak like a gutter child, and
the face which he turned upon Eberhard was startlingly
beautiful. Still the Duke was suspicious. Why should this
boy be slinking to the castle by night? His Highness disliked
mysteries, or thought he did; though, as a matter of fact,
he was always attracted by the mysterious, afraid of it, yet
anxious to unravel. He gave the boy another shake. It was
a physical relief to shake some one after the long hours of
anxiety, and the control he had been forced to exercise upon
his longing to shake the Duchess&mdash;no new wish on his part,
and the only desire that estimable lady had inspired in his
breast for many years. So the Duke shook his little
prisoner again and again.</p>

<p>The boy remained passive; he was breathless, but he met
the Duke's half-laughing, half-angry eyes with a bold look of
defiance.</p>

<p>His Highness ceased shaking the child, feeling distinctly
ashamed. 'Will he tell me now?' he asked more gently.</p>

<p>As he said the words, something caught the uncertain light
of the lamps&mdash;a little jewel which glittered in the boy's coat.
It was exposed to view by the disarrangement of the cloak
caused by the rough handling.</p>

<p>'Lord God!' exclaimed the Duke, catching the boy by the
arm once more, 'where in the devil's name did you get
that?'</p>

<p>The boy clasped his free hand over the jewel, and proceeded
to kick Eberhard Ludwig's shins with all the violence he could
muster. 'A lady gave it to me, and you shall never have it!
I will kill you sooner!' he cried grandiloquently.</p>

<p>'Be quiet, boy. I am a friend; tell me your errand. If it
concerns the lady who gave you that jewel, I alone can be of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
assistance.' In his voice lay so pure a note of truth that the
boy instinctively turned to him trustfully.</p>

<p>'I have a message for the Duke from the lady. If you are
a friend to her, you can tell me how to find him. The lady
says I am to go to the castle and ask for Madame de Ruth,
who will take me to his Highness if he has come back from
hunting; then she said all would be well.'</p>

<p>To the boy's astonishment his big questioner suddenly let
go his arm, and, leaning against the house wall, covered his
face with his hands, shivered as though from an ague fit.
When the man took his hands from before his face, the child
saw that his eyes were full of tears. The boy wondered why
so many grown-up people were so foolish.</p>

<p>'Quick, boy! take me to her!' he cried.</p>

<p>'No; that is just what I am not to do,' was the reply. 'I
am to tell her where the Duke will meet her to-morrow
morning early.'</p>

<p>'To-morrow morning! A million leaden moments! a century
to pass! No! Boy, take me to her! I am the Duke;
take me to her, I order you.'</p>

<p>'No; you may be the Duke, but she has given me her
commands, and they mean more to me than yours.' The boy
threw up his head proudly. Even in his passionate impatience
Serenissimus was struck by the boy's manner,
amused by this small gentleman.</p>

<p>'Preux Chevalier!' he said laughing; then bowing gravely
to the little muffled figure, 'you are perfectly correct, and I
stand reproved; but at least do me the honour to carry this
ring to the lady, and tell her that I await either her or her
sovereign commands.'</p>

<p>The boy took the ring and vanished into the blackness of
the side street. Eberhard Ludwig remained looking after him
into the gloom. A bitter thought came to him of the
superiority of this child of the back streets over the Erbprinz
of Wirtemberg&mdash;that poor, sickly, excitable boy, whose disappointing
personality was a source of constant irritation and
humiliation to his father. Eberhard Ludwig loved personal
vitality, and that vigorous manliness which he himself
possessed, and which he saw daily in the sons of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
poorest subjects; and he suffered intensely when he was
brought into contact with his puny, unwholesome son. The
Duchess's passionate spoiling and injudicious love made
matters worse; the boy's health was in nowise benefited
thereby, and it but served to accentuate the fact that his
father had little else save impatient pity to bestow upon his
disappointing offspring. This was in Eberhard Ludwig's mind
as his eyes rested absently upon the street opening whither
had vanished the erect little form of Joseph S&uuml;ss&mdash;'preux
chevalier,' as the Duke had dubbed him. The summer
storm had passed, leaving a delicious freshness in the air
and a fragrance which penetrated from the gardens to the
Duke. Eberhard Ludwig stood waiting near the entrance to
the narrow street or gangway, where the overhanging roofs
dripped large splashing drops upon the unpaved earth below.
Now that realisation was in all probability so near, his wild
desire for Wilhelmine seemed to have passed; a curious
anxiety had taken its place. How strange, the Duke reflected,
that loss or absence should enhance the value of the beloved.
He tried to conjure up his agony of longing for his mistress.
What mad rapture, could he have clasped her at the moment
of tremendous desire which had been his half an hour earlier
in the castle garden! Are we really only children crying
for the moon? and if the moon were given to us, should we
but throw it away into the nearest ditch&mdash;merely another
broken toy? he thought. These moods of Eberhard Ludwig's
were frequent. Like all poets, he had a vein of melancholy, a
tendency to indulge himself in a half-sensuous sadness, and
these dreamings of his, which had never been received with
ought save uncomprehending impatience by the Duchess,
Wilhelmine had known so well how to assuage&mdash;not entirely
to dissipate, for she would have robbed him of a certain
joy had she done so; but she humoured him, understood him,
wandered with him in the paths of his enchanted melancholy,
then suddenly brought him back to gaiety by some witty
word, some tender pleasantry. It was part of her immense
power over him, and indeed, it was no thing of the senses,
but rather her womanly genius, her innate knowledge of
loving. As he stood awaiting her, his heart cried for her; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
was no longer stirred by physical desire, but he craved the
consolation of her presence as a child wearies for its mother's
love. Indeed, in most passions which have outlasted the flash
of sheer animal attraction, there has ever been that touch of
mother-love in the affection given by the woman to the man.
And it is this which eternally makes the entirely desirable
woman older than the man she loves.</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly as Eberhard Ludwig stood
waiting for some sign from Wilhelmine. At length his
Highness heard an approaching footstep. He turned quickly,
in his excitement not noting that the steps came from the
direction of the castle garden. He started forward with
outstretched arms. Forstner stood before him, a ridiculous
figure as usual; his large, tiresome nose shadowed on the
wall by the uncertain light of the hanging lanterns.</p>

<p>'Really, Monsieur de Forstner!' broke out the Duke
angrily, 'it is intolerable to be thus followed! Am I not at
liberty to take a stroll unquestioned?'</p>

<p>The astonished courtier attempted to explain that he had
not known his Highness to be wandering near the Judengasse,
but Eberhard Ludwig cut him short and desired him to go on
his way. Forstner begged to be permitted to accompany his
Highness. 'This is not a part of the town where it is fitting
your Highness should be alone at night.' The reproving tone
of the schoolmaster (that inextinguishable dweller of the
innermost which abides for ever in the breast of every honest
German) crept into the words, and Eberhard Ludwig's irritation
was the more aroused.</p>

<p>'Will you go and leave me to myself, Forstner, you
insufferable ass!' The words broke forth half fiercely, half
humorously.</p>

<p>Forstner drew himself up with a certain stiff dignity.
'Were that term applied to me by any but my Prince, I
should answer with the sword,' he said.</p>

<p>The Duke laughed impatiently. 'I retract&mdash;I apologise&mdash;I
beg your forgiveness; you are an excellent fellow, a dear
friend&mdash;only for God's sake, man, go away!'</p>

<p>'But your Highness&mdash;I beg you to consider&mdash;&mdash;' the other
began.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
'Look here, Forstner,' the Duke interrupted, 'if you don't
go&mdash;now, at once, and leave me alone, upon my soul I will run
you through!' He half-drew his sword.</p>

<p>'Really, Monseigneur,' replied Forstner, 'I am ready to
obey your Highness, but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, then, <i>go</i>!' The Duke was getting beyond himself;
each moment he feared Wilhelmine would appear, and Forstner
was not a person he desired as witness either to his meeting
with his beloved, or to her advent from the lowest part of the
town.</p>

<p>The estimable Forstner had at length commenced his
departure, but he was distant only a few paces when the
Duke heard a laugh coming from the gloom of the shadowed
Judengasse. It was a laugh which, though low-pitched and
quiet, had a resonant distinctness which caused it to carry
a long way.</p>

<p>'Wait, for Heaven's sake, till he is gone,' his Highness
whispered over his shoulder into the darkness, observing to
his dismay that Forstner had halted.</p>

<p>'Did your Highness call me?' asked the too-devoted
friend, and made as though to return.</p>

<p>'No; I coughed. Do go away!' shouted the Duke in
return, and set himself to cough vigorously, for behind him
from the darkened street there came the unmistakable sound
of Wilhelmine's irrepressible laughter.</p>

<p>At length the angular figure vanished, and the Duke sprang
round with arms outstretched, and into them he received the
stately form of his mistress, who lay upon his breast; for once
unresponsive to his passionate kisses, while she laughed in a
very agony of mirth.</p>

<p>'Forgive me, Monseigneur,' she said at last, her voice still
shaking with laughter; 'but you know the scene was really
beyond me. I heard all, and oh! Forstner was so droll, and
you too.' She began to laugh again. 'Oh, how delightfully
undignified, mon Prince&mdash;when you coughed to hide my
laughter.'</p>

<p>Once more she leaned against Eberhard Ludwig's shoulder
and rocked with merriment. The Duke also laughed, but a
trifle ruefully; that meddler Forstner had destroyed the rapture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>
of his meeting with Wilhelmine, had broken the charm of his
pensive mood; and besides, the Duke knew from experience
that when Wilhelmine began to laugh like that he would
probably hear no serious word from her during the evening.
Even in their passion's transports he had known his mistress
suddenly go off into a series of 'fous rires,' and no man enjoys
the most harmless laughter at such moments.</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine, for God's sake stop laughing, and tell me
where you have been since the Duchess&mdash;since the Duchess&mdash;&mdash;'
he hesitated, not knowing how to express the summary
ejection from the castle.</p>

<p>'Since her Highness had the goodness to turn me out.'
Wilhelmine was serious now, though her lips still twitched
with mirth, and her eyes were mischievous and teasing.
'Nay, your Highness, that is my secret. I have always a
hiding-place whither I can vanish when you are not good to
me. Shall I disappear again? I have but to say a mystic
word and your Highness will clasp empty air.' She was play-acting,
as she often did, and she looked up at him with such
dazzling eyes that he caught her to him with masterful passion.</p>

<p>'Witch! enchantress!' he murmured. 'What matters it
where you were; you are here now with me, and never to part
again!'</p>

<p>'Till death us do part,' she answered. 'Nay, those are the
words men say to their wives, not to their&mdash;&mdash;' A note of
bitterness pierced the mockery of her tone.</p>

<p>'Ah! heart of mine,' he broke in vehemently, 'would that
I could make you Duchess! You are my wife by all laws
of fairest nature and love! This is a more holy thing than
marriage&mdash;nay, this is true marriage!' It was the eternal lie
of lovers: the old futile, pathetic, impossible pleading of those
whose love cannot be sanctioned by law. Wilhelmine's face
darkened.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, if you could make Forstner and his sort
believe that, I should not be taunted and insulted. But come,
now, we cannot discuss this here. Will you tell me where
you propose to lodge me this night, or shall I vanish again?'
Her gaiety had returned.</p>

<p>'I must ask you to accept the hospitality of my roof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
to-night,' he said gravely; 'to-morrow I will seek a fitting
abode for you.'</p>

<p>'Ah! a mistress's separate establishment.' Her voice was
bitter again. Was there ever such a difficult woman for lover
to deal with? But that was half her charm.</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine, do not torture me. I will do all I can, and
I pray you, never call your house a mistress's establishment&mdash;call
it rather the palace of my heart's queen.'</p>

<p>'Prettily put, and meaning exactly the same!'</p>

<p>She was laughing once more; she loved when Eberhard
Ludwig spoke in this chivalrous tone, as every woman does,
thinking it a tribute to her own especial dignity when it is
often only a deft trick of speech. Laughing and talking and
teasing her beloved, she allowed him to lead her away through
the gardens.</p>

<p>Within the castle commotion prevailed. Serving-men
and maids ran hither and thither in an excited and
aimless fashion; they started back in surprise and dismay
when they perceived Wilhelmine's tall figure beside the
Duke, but neither his Highness nor the lady stopped to
question the servants on the cause of the disturbance. When
they reached the first floor, where dwelt the Duchess Johanna
Elizabetha, and would have passed on to gain Wilhelmine's
apartments, they found themselves confronted by a group of
persons talking in excited whispers. Prelate Osiander,
certainly not one whom Eberhard Ludwig desired as a witness
to Wilhelmine's re-entry; Madame de Stafforth, the Countess
Gemmingen, one of the Duchess's ladies; Dr. M&uuml;rger, second
court physician; two of her Highness's waiting-women.
Madame de Ruth was also there, and it struck Wilhelmine
as ominous that the lady of many words and ready wit stood
silent and constrained.</p>

<p>'What is this?' queried Eberhard Ludwig angrily in a
loud tone. The assembled persons turned in startled surprise.
Osiander came forward.</p>

<p>'Your Highness's wife, the Duchess Johanna Elizabetha, is
sick unto death, and your Highness was not to be found for
all our search,' he said sternly, and without deigning to cast a
glance upon Wilhelmine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
'What ails the Duchess?' asked Eberhard Ludwig, turning
to Dr. M&uuml;rger.</p>

<p>'It would seem to be a stroke of blood to the brain, your
Highness&mdash;a dangerous thing to one of the Duchess's robust
physique. Dr. Schubart is occupied in bleeding her Highness.
My assistance was dispensed with,' he added in an offended
tone.</p>

<p>At this moment the door of the Duchess's chamber opened,
and Monsieur le Docteur Schubart, first doctor to the court
and a very pompous person, appeared.</p>

<p>'I am relieved to be able to declare her Highness the
Duchess to be returned from her strange swoon. I have the
honour to announce that her Highness's cherished life will be
spared to her devoted subjects.'</p>

<p>The man was odiously unctuous and self-satisfied. Madame
de Stafforth burst into weak weeping, while Osiander gravely
offered his congratulations to Eberhard Ludwig upon the recovery
of 'his noble and devoted wife.' There lay something
of true dignity and sober goodness in the Prelate's whole being
which never failed to impress Wilhelmine, and she felt his entire
ignoring of her to be a heavy public reproof from a competent
judge. There was a moment's awkward silence when
the Prelate ceased speaking, and every eye was turned to the
pair of handsome lovers as they stood side by side, framed in
the oaken panelling of the doorway leading to the stairs.
Madame de Ruth, who hated pauses, came forward and held
out her hand to Wilhelmine.</p>

<p>'My dear, I am glad to see you,' she said kindly.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine, whom Osiander's disapproval had irritated,
replied calmly: 'Yes, I have returned, and to stay this time!'
It was said defiantly.</p>

<p>Now it is well known that love makes the wisest of mankind
foolish, and that the poet in love is a perfectly unaccountable
being. Eberhard Ludwig was poet and lover, and he lost his
head on this occasion.</p>

<p>'Returned to stay, dear lady, as long as my poor court can
harbour and amuse so fair a visitant!' he said; then, turning
to Madame de Ruth, he added in a lower tone, which was yet
perfectly audible to most of the assembled company: 'The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
rain-cloud brought back sunshine to us. A flash of lightning
carried her from Elysium to earth once more. A mysterious
Black Cupid led her to me! but we must be very careful, for
she can vanish at will, this beautiful enchantress.'</p>

<p>It was said in extravagant homage, half in pleasantry, but
several of those present, and notably the Duchess's waiting-women,
heard the unwise words. When Wilhelmine swept
past them on her way to her chamber they drew back in
superstitious awe, and she heard them murmur, 'Witch and
sorceress! we must not offend her.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE ATTACK IN THE GROTTO</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> court of Stuttgart soon saw to its cost that Wilhelmine
had of a truth 'come to stay this time,' as she herself
had announced on the evening of her return from the
Judengasse. After a few days spent in her old quarters
in the castle, she removed to a hastily improvised abode
on the first floor of the Duke's J&auml;gerhaus. Here had
been the official residence of his Highness's Grand Ma&icirc;tre
de la Meute, and this personage, who was relegated to a
small and inconvenient dwelling-place, naturally resented
his eviction. Public disapproval was excited by the
summary commandeering of a well-known official residence;
and when, following upon their keeper's ejection, the stag-hounds
and hare-coursers were removed from the J&auml;gerhaus,
the Stuttgarters murmured ominously. It had long
been a highly prized privilege of the townsfolk to repair,
each Sunday and Feast-day, to view the hounds&mdash;in fact, this
custom had become one of their social entertainments. The
burghers and their families were wont to meet together in
the stretch of garden which bordered the open rails of the
enclosure, where the hounds took their afternoon airing on
idle, non-hunting days. The citizens loved to watch the dogs'
antics, and regarded it as their recognised Sunday afternoon
amusement. In the Graben, or disused town moat, turned
road, stood the J&auml;gerhaus&mdash;a long, barn-like building, the entire
ground-floor whereof was occupied by the dog-kennels, which
opened to the back on paddocks. On the first floor were
many spacious apartments, hitherto used for the administration
of the affairs of his Highness's hunt, and for lodging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>
the J&auml;germasters of distant posts in the forests, who came to
Stuttgart on official business; and here, too, was the residence
of the Grand Master of the Hunt and hounds. On the third
floor, beneath the high sloping roof, were a few garrets and
several large lofts filled with the straw destined for the dog-kennels.
The mingled odours of hounds and straw displeased
Wilhelmine's acute sense of smell, and one of her first
commands upon entering her new abode was that hounds
and straw should be removed instantly. She declared that
therefrom the whole house was infested with fleas, and when
the Duke, wishful to propitiate the angry lady, proposed to
send for the late occupant of the J&auml;gerhaus to inquire if he
had been aware of his neighbours, the fleas, she remarked
angrily that fleas were dainty feeders and, like Jews, were not
in the habit of selecting pigskin for food. This remark was
evidently heard by some unfriendly person, for on the morrow
it was the common talk of the town. A few days later the
hounds were seen progressing through Stuttgart on their way
to temporary kennels hastily arranged in the Rothwald. The
populace followed this cort&egrave;ge shouting, 'They are taking
away our beautiful hounds, and leaving an accursed bitch in
the old kennels!' And that day when Serenissimus drove
out, accompanied as usual by Wilhelmine, he was met by an
angry murmuring crowd. Here was the beginning of that
unpopularity of Wilhelmine's which gave the lie to the
devotion of her friends, and notably her personal attendants
and servants. This unpopularity which had so terrible an
effect on her character, hardening her heart, accentuating the
underlying cruelty, the indifference to aught save her own
pleasure and power. Feeling herself accounted evil, she
became so. It was this, taken together with her magnificent
success and her extraordinary prosperity, which caused her to
become a cruel and self-seeking woman. Monsieur Gabriel,
in the far-off days at G&uuml;strow, had feared this development,
had trembled before the world-hardness which would mar the
being he loved. How many have trembled at the same
thought, and in sadness and loneliness have realised that
their dread has become a cruel reality! We can face Death
for those we love, mourning them in agony and tears, but we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
can find no beauty in that bitter and hideous grief which
comes to us when those we loved, we trusted, we admired,
change to us&mdash;worst of all, change in themselves. This is the
inexorable Death in Life, and in this Death we cannot dream
of a fair consoling Hereafter. The thing we loved has not only
perished&mdash;alas! we realise that it has never existed! What
we worshipped was the shadow of our own making, a mirage
conjured up by our heart's desire. To those who love most,
love best, this tragedy comes.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine, who arrived in Wirtemberg a strong, passionate
creature, generous, vital, was too responsive to remain unaltered
by the alchemising touch of the world. Had she
been met with tenderness and purity, and by noble men
and women, she might have become a power for good; as
it was, she was received by intrigue, contending interests,
disapproval, distrust, the lust of love. As a good woman
there was no place for her at Wirtemberg's court, so
all the evil, lying dormant in every human heart, rose up
in her, and she became a Queen of Wickedness. Monsieur
Gabriel would have mourned another lost illusion, had not
Death taken him from this world a few months after Wilhelmine's
departure from G&uuml;strow. He bequeathed to her his
well-worn books, <i>Les Pens&eacute;es de Pascal</i>, <i>Le Roman de la Rose</i>,
the poems of the singers of La Ple&iuml;ade, and the few other
volumes wherefrom he had instructed his beloved pupil. He
left, besides, a little sealed packet, in which she was surprised
to find several beautiful jewels, among them a white enamel
cross, in the centre whereof was the image of a dove with
outspread wings.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig told her these were the insignia of a high
order in France, and she was thereby confirmed in her notion
that her beloved old schoolmaster's great air and immense
refinement were those of a grand seigneur. She often pondered
on why a Huguenot had been permitted to bear the holy order
of the St. Esprit upon his breast, but she remembered that
Monsieur Gabriel had spoken of the court festivities with
that sure accent which told that he had been of the caste
which took part in those scenes. She never learnt his secret;
to her credit, she never sought to unravel it. The Gr&auml;venitz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
was what the world calls wicked, but vulgarity and vulgarity's
attendant, curiosity, could not touch her, and she respected
the silence of her friends, though she ever spied upon her
enemies. The news of Monsieur Gabriel's death was brought
to Wilhelmine soon after her advent at the J&auml;gerhaus, and for
many days the favourite refused to see any one save Eberhard
Ludwig. She mourned her old friend sincerely, and wept
bitterly when she saw the worn volumes he had bequeathed
to her. The cross she fastened round her neck on a thin gold
chain, and this badge of a sacred order rested for many years
on the heart of the strange, evil woman. You can see the
tiny line of this chain in the few known portraits of Wilhelmine
von Gr&auml;venitz. These pictures are very rare, Time and
Hatred have hidden them but too well. Indeed, it is as
though all the Swabian virtue had conspired together to
obliterate the memory, with the portraits, of the abhorred
'Gr&auml;venitzin.'</p>

<p>For the nonce, life was very peaceful for Wilhelmine in the
J&auml;gerhaus; and the Duke, entirely enthralled by his mistress,
humoured her every whim. Madame de Ruth said mockingly
to Zollern that a more exemplary young married couple than
'Monsieur et Madame Eberhard Ludwig' she had never seen.
But the feeling against the favourite in Stuttgart grew each
day, and the fact that his Highness had caused much that was of
beauty and value in the castle to be removed to the J&auml;gerhaus
gave umbrage to the courtiers. Even Zollern remonstrated,
but in vain. Meanwhile the J&auml;gerhaus had become a splendid
abode: rich yellow silken hangings hid the bare whitewashed
walls of the chamber Wilhelmine had selected for her reception-room;
the old wooden floors had been polished till
they appeared to be the finest parquet; gilt chairs deeply
cushioned, and also of that delicate yellow colour which the
favourite loved, had been brought from Paris; a spinet with
a beautifully painted case stood near the window; a quaint
sixteenth-century stove which had been in the state room at
the castle had been chosen by her as harmonising well with
the yellow hangings, being made of light blue tiles. In
an alcove, especially constructed by grumbling, slow-handed
Stuttgart workmen for the 'Duke's Witch,' was the pick of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>
the ducal library. The court ladies heard with jealous rage,
that the Gr&auml;venitzin had a dressing-room entirely panelled
with mirrors, that her bed was hung with light blue silk, that
she had a silver bath surrounded by mirror screens. How
had the Mecklemburg <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fra&uuml;lein'">Fr&auml;ulein</ins> learnt such things? they asked.
How indeed, but in her inborn genius for luxury! The
favourite's servants were magnificently attired in ducal
liveries. The lady had her own carriage with painted panels
and yellow satin cushions. She gave rich entertainments,
and the invitations were coveted, of course, by the good
people who were so horrified at their hostess. The Duchess
Johanna Elizabetha would not be present at a court feast
where the Gr&auml;venitz appeared? Very well! there <i>were</i> no
court feasts! All the gaiety of the autumn of 1706 and the
winter of 1707 took place at the J&auml;gerhaus.</p>

<p>The Duchess-mother, from her dower-house of Stetten,
descended periodically upon Stuttgart, rated her son,
condoled with Johanna Elizabetha, and returned utterly
unsuccessful to Stetten.</p>

<p>Forstner's warning voice was never silent. Osiander failed
to return Wilhelmine's salutation when she encountered him
in the Lustgarten. It was open war between virtue and the
Gr&auml;venitz.</p>

<p>Stuttgart in the winter is a vastly different place to the
smiling, gay Stuttgart of spring and summer days, and Wilhelmine
often wondered whither had vanished the charm, the
delight of Southern Germany. That winter there fell but
little snow, a cruel black frost was over the whole valley;
sometimes the frost relaxed his iron grip, and then came
torrents of rain. The frost returned when the rain ceased,
and taking the wet earth into his gaunt hands turned everything
into dirty sheet ice. In Wilhelmine's yellow room at
the J&auml;gerhaus the blue stove radiated a pleasant warmth,
and, if a feeble sunray struggled through the gloomy, leaden
sky, the yellow hangings caught it like a lover, and seemed to
treasure it, filling the whole room with a hint of spring sunshine.
In the castle the Duchess sat in her sombre apartments
which she had made as dull, as dreary, as charmless as
herself. Eberhard Ludwig seldom visited her, and she spent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>
her time in cosseting the sickly Erbprinz, or bemoaning her
fate to Madame de Stafforth.</p>

<p>Slowly the winter left the land, but the spring that year
was a meagre starveling, niggardly of smiles. He seemed to
have borrowed winter's breath, and the pale young leaves
shuddered in the unfriendly blasts. The fruit blossom
struggled into a nipped existence, and fell like thin snow to
the ground. An eerie spring, and men said there was a spell
upon the country, and looked towards the J&auml;gerhaus as they
spoke.</p>

<p>During the winter the French army under Mar&eacute;chal Villars
had again threatened Wirtemberg. On a cheerless day towards
the end of April Eberhard Ludwig arrived as usual in the early
morning to visit his beloved at the J&auml;gerhaus. For several
days she had noticed a cloud upon his brow, he had answered
her absently, and she knew instinctively that there was something
on his mind, which he desired to tell her. Too wise
to question him, she watched him closely. When he entered
the yellow-hung salon that cheerless April morning, he greeted
her almost coldly, and began to play roughly with his huge
black wolf-hound, M&eacute;lac. This animal was the Duke's constant
companion&mdash;an extraordinarily sagacious beast, whom
Wilhelmine declared to be a hater of dullness because he
had ever been surly towards Johanna Elizabetha. For the
favourite the dog had a marked affection; he would lie near
her with his large head resting on her foot, while his patient
eyes looked up at her with that strange, unblinking gaze
which is characteristic of the wolf-hound.</p>

<p>There was something brutal in the way Eberhard Ludwig
teased the dog that morning; he hurt the poor brute, pulling
his short, sensitive ears, drawing M&eacute;lac roughly back then
flinging him away. It was a cruel game, more like a combat
between man and hound; and M&eacute;lac, good, generous beast
though he was, began to get angry. The Duke's hand had
been scratched by the dog's sharp teeth, and the wolf-hound
tasting blood, grew ferocious. With a growl M&eacute;lac suddenly
reared up on his hind legs and placed his front paws on the
Duke's breast, his teeth bared in an ugly snarl. Eberhard
Ludwig laughed, but the dog's fangs were dangerously near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
his Highness's throat; and indeed it was no laughing matter,
for a wolf-hound, once his teeth are fastened in a man's
throat, does not leave his prey alive. It was a grim comedy.
Wilhelmine rose from her chair near the window and came
forward.</p>

<p>'Leave him to me!' shouted the Duke, at length aware of
his danger. He gripped M&eacute;lac by the ears and held the
beast from him; but the hound was thoroughly aroused, and
Eberhard Ludwig felt that it was an unequal contest in spite
of his strength.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine advanced fearlessly, and laying her hand upon
the dog's head, she leaned round till she faced the snarling
brute.</p>

<p>'What are you doing, Wilhelmine?' panted the Duke.
'For God's sake do not put your face so close to his teeth!'</p>

<p>'I know what I am doing, mon Prince,' she said calmly.</p>

<p>As at G&uuml;strow, when M&uuml;ller had attacked her, she now
narrowed her lids and forced her will into her eyes. Gradually
she felt her mastery working on M&eacute;lac; his jaws dropped, no
longer fiercely baring the teeth but as though he had run a
long distance, the whole mouth became weak, the red tongue
protruding. With a whine the dog fell, his front paws slipping
from the Duke's shoulders. Shuddering, the great animal
crouched on the floor, his eyes still resting on Wilhelmine
with an expression of abject terror.</p>

<p>'Lie quiet, M&eacute;lac! There&mdash;good dog!' She stroked his
head, and the hound fawned upon her, dragging himself round
her feet, crawling, abased.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig caught her hand, and his own trembled a
little. 'What an extraordinary thing! Did you put a spell
upon M&eacute;lac? I have never seen him thus cowed! Beloved,
I believe I owe my life to you this morning,' he said.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine passed her hand across her eyes. 'So may all
your enemies be defeated!' she said, laughing.</p>

<p>'Could you make me tremble like that with your wonderful
eyes?' he asked. He was fascinated, yet there was something
terrible to him in this woman's power.</p>

<p>'Mon Prince, you are my master always,' she returned; and
the subtle flattery of being the avowed ruler of so potent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
being delighted him, as it pleases all men, who are obviously
slaves, to be called master by the woman who controls them.</p>

<p>'Alas! but I am not the master of destiny,' he said sadly,
'and I come this morning to prove it. Wilhelmine, beloved,
I must return to the army. We have information that Villars
is to invade Wirtemberg once more, and I must be with the
forces.'</p>

<p>'Is our happiness over then?' she queried.</p>

<p>'Ah! no, no, beloved of my life! You will wait for me here,
I shall return in a few months.'</p>

<p>'Months! Months of Stuttgart without you? Ah! Eberhard,
you cannot ask it!' She pleaded long, but for once the
Duke was obdurate: he must go, he said; honour demanded it.</p>

<p>On the day fixed for Eberhard Ludwig's departure there
was much stir in Stuttgart, and the people crowded the streets
to show honour to their Duke, whose popularity was suddenly
reawakened by his reassumption of the r&ocirc;le of military hero.
Johanna Elizabetha was to accompany the Duke out of the
town; once again she was to be permitted to play her part as
wife and Duchess. Forstner had achieved this, with the help
of Osiander, who was to pronounce a blessing on the Duke
and his body-guard on the market-place ere they set forth.
The Prelate declared he would refuse his benediction were the
Duchess not accorded her fitting place in the ceremony. Wilhelmine
was enraged. It is hard for a woman to see another
recognised as the beloved's wife, besides she regarded this as a
slight to herself. It was terrible to her, and she stormed and
raged and reproached the Duke, demanding what was to be her
place in the ceremony. Then, in tears, she caressed him.</p>

<p>Of course, the Duke blamed Johanna Elizabetha for this
scene. When do we ever blame the right person for the disagreeable
happenings of our lives?</p>

<p>At length Serenissimus tore himself away from his mistress,
carrying in his heart her picture in her yellow, sunlit room,
crying bitterly with face hidden in her hands. He hated tears,
but Wilhelmine's weeping was so different from that of
other women, he reflected, as he wended his way through the
gardens towards the castle to mount his charger and head the
procession to the market-place, and thence away to the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
frontier. He had taken leave of Johanna Elizabetha that
morning, for though she was to assist in the ceremony of
departure, he had granted her request for a previous farewell
in private. The Duchess had met him with tear-swollen lids,
and had wept incessantly during the short interview. The
poor soul had shown her grief in a most unbecoming way; her
mouth grimaced ridiculously when she cried, 'like a squalling
brat's,' his Highness had reflected bitterly.</p>

<p>Ah! the difference when Wilhelmine wept&mdash;her head
bowed down with sadness, her face hidden. It was so graceful,
so poetic; of course the secret was, that when she wept
she hid her face. A really clever woman of the world would
never show the grimace of sorrow: she may weep, but she
hides her face, well knowing that a weeping woman is a
hideous sight; but all this Eberhard Ludwig did not know.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wilhelmine sat in her yellow salon listening to
the sounds from the market-place which floated to her across
the gardens behind the J&auml;gerhaus. She heard the flare of
trumpets which greeted the Duke, the roar of the enthusiastic
people acclaiming their warlike sovereign; then followed
silence, Osiander must be pronouncing his benediction, she
thought. Again a flourish of trumpets, men shouting, and
then she heard the grand hymn, 'Ein' Feste Burg ist unser
Gott,' sung by thousands of voices and brayed out by the brass
instruments. The sound came nearer: she could hear the
tramp of feet, the clatter of horses, the cries of the people.
The musicians played a march: it seemed to Wilhelmine that
it became more triumphant, more blatant, as the cort&egrave;ge
passed near the J&auml;gerhaus; yet the boisterous military music
held a note of pathos, something infinitely moving at this
terrible farewell hour, and the listening woman wept bitterly,
and, God knows! she forgot to hide her sorrow-distorted mouth
at that moment.</p>

<hr />

<p>The days dragged on. May came cold and unfriendly, as
April had been, and Wilhelmine thought that all the warmth
of the world must have departed when Eberhard Ludwig went
to the frontier to do battle. The lilacs came to a tardy bloom,
and even on the cold ungenial air there floated a divine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>
fragrance. News came from the Duke&mdash;dull news, all detail
of the organising and improvement of troops. Passionate
words intermingled in these letters to Wilhelmine, old faded
yellow curiosities now. Madame de Ruth, Zollern, and
Stafforth often visited the favourite at the J&auml;gerhaus, and
Wilhelmine's innate desire to please&mdash;that impulse which must
ever belong to the 'charmeurs' and especially to the 'charmeuses'
of the world&mdash;taught her to forget her sadness
when she was with her friends, and thus some brighter
hours were passed. She sang, and if her singing were more
truthfully passionate and more sad than of yore, it was surely
love which had taught her greater depth. Only Madame de
Ruth, the old courtesan, realised that not love but love's
sadness had given that tone to the glorious voice; and Madame
de Ruth looked at Zollern, her eyes full of tears, but Zollern
leaned his chin on the mythologically ornamented china
handle of his stick and revelled in a thrill, a spark of youth's
desire, which the younger woman's voice had rekindled. Men
are promiscuous to the end of their lives. Why blame them?
God made them so.</p>

<p>Towards the beginning of May, shortly after his Highness's
departure, Madame de Ruth arrived one morning at the
J&auml;gerhaus brimming over with words and gossip. 'Imagine,
ma ch&egrave;re,' she cried, as she rustled into Wilhelmine's yellow
salon, 'Osiander is in disgrace with the Duchess! I heard
it was coming, but did not believe it. As you know, her
Highness has given orders that, being in spiritual mourning
in the absence of her dear spouse at the war, she will see
none save her personal attendants and Madame de Stafforth.
Well, well, it is quite contrary to every etiquette; but, indeed,
the court of Stuttgart has ceased to exist nowadays, and her
Highness can do as she likes.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; I know all that. Tell me what the news is!'
broke in Wilhelmine impatiently. The Duchess's entire
seclusion was well known to her, she heard it discussed by
her friends daily.</p>

<p>'Let me tell you my story in my own way, or I shall not
tell it at all! Well, I live in the castle.'&mdash;'I know that too,'
said Wilhelmine, laughing.&mdash;'Certainly you do&mdash;I live in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>
castle, and really it is ridiculous if I never see the Duchess,
considering that I am her resident Ma&icirc;tresse du Palais; so at
last I wrote to the Duchess saying I begged an audience, as
really being of no use to her Highness I wished for leave of
absence, but must crave a moment's conversation with her
before I left.'</p>

<p>'Are you going to leave?' said Wilhelmine anxiously.</p>

<p>'Jamais de la vie, ma ch&egrave;re! but I wanted to see the Duchess,
and this was the only way. Well, she consented to see me, so
I went to her yesterday evening, found her with la Stafforth
sewing shirts for the poor&mdash;very estimable! She was far
from amiable to me; asked me if I meant to cease being
Ma&icirc;tresse du Palais, and become Dame de D&eacute;shonneur to
Fr&auml;ulein von Gr&auml;venitz. Upon my word, I had not credited
her with wit enough for so cutting a saying; then I told her
I should be obliged to resign, and had written to Serenissimus
saying her Highness's refusals to see me made my position
ridiculous. She replied that I could do as I wished, and just
as I was preparing to take leave of her Highness, Osiander was
announced. It amused me to hear, so I drew back into the
shadow&mdash;you know the Duchess's rooms have always much
shadow. Well, Osiander declared he had given his best
attention to her Highness's demand, but regretted to be
unable to accede to her request. The Duchess seemed much
annoyed, and said that in this case she would invite the
Pietist to preach to her in the castle itself. Osiander told
her that this, of course, was as her Highness willed, but that
Pietists being members of a sect not recognised by the State,
he could not permit a sermon to be preached in the Duke's
chapel or in the Stiftskirche by a travelling Pietist preacher.
The Duchess bowed to him in dismissal, and remarked that this
M&uuml;ller was a saint she had heard, and inspired by God&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'M&uuml;ller?' cried Wilhelmine&mdash;'M&uuml;ller? a preacher? Where
does he come from?'</p>

<p>'My dear, that is just the strange thing. Of course, directly
Osiander departed, I made my courtesy to her Highness&mdash;she
didn't try to keep me, you may be sure!&mdash;and I hurried after
the Prelate. I found him on the stairs in great distress,
poor man, for it appears her Highness has tried to have some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
of these Pietists to preach in church before. She is filled with
curiosity, which she calls sympathy with the simple, stern
religion; and this M&uuml;ller, who goes about preaching, is now at
T&uuml;bingen. La Stafforth heard about him from some servant,
and has filled her Highness's head with foolish notions,
amongst others, that he is sent by God to console her!</p>

<p>'It appears, my dear, and this is the disagreeable part, that
he preaches directly against you&mdash;naming you by name, and
saying you are a walking contamination; that you are a witch,
and that in Mecklemburg it was well known! He can vouch
for it, as he was pastor at G&uuml;strow before God called him&mdash;which
means before he became a wandering Pietist preacher.
All this Osiander told me, and, to do him justice, he was
horrified at the whole thing and very angry with her Highness.
I suppose M&uuml;ller is a madman, a fanatic; but, Wilhelmine,
I think we had best journey to the Neuhaus together
and stay there till the Duke's return, for I do not trust the
people here. There is a strong feeling against you, and if they
are to be stirred up by this preaching rascal, it might really
be disagreeable.' She paused breathless.</p>

<p>'He is a terrible man, a devil, and I am convinced he has
followed me to Wirtemberg for revenge,' said Wilhelmine; and
then she told Madame de Ruth of M&uuml;ller's behaviour at
G&uuml;strow, and of how she had interrupted his sermon. Madame
de Ruth laughed, though she was anxious and distressed that
this dangerous enemy was working against Wilhelmine in
the Duke's absence, especially when she heard that M&uuml;ller
was a powerful preacher gifted with the fanatic's vivid
eloquence.</p>

<p>'One thing perplexes me,' said the Gr&auml;venitz, 'why does
Osiander oppose this man? Surely to harm me any means
would be welcome!'</p>

<p>'Yes, doubtless!' replied Madame de Ruth, 'but of the
two evils in the land he considers you the lesser; for you, my
dear, are frankly of the devil, and the Church can abhor you,
but Pietism is a wolf in sheep's clothing which might eat up
the Church! All these Churchmen fear that the Pietists
should get hold of the people&mdash;above all, in this case, of the
Duchess and her tiresome court. It is simply, as usual, one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
faction against the other. Though, of course, Osiander as a
gentleman and a scholar is naturally opposed to ranting
preachers and religion vulgarised.'</p>

<p>It was settled that Madame de Ruth and Wilhelmine were
to start for the Neuhaus as soon as fitting arrangements could
be made, and the Gr&auml;venitz looked forward with pleasure to
the quiet summer hours she would spend reading beneath the
beech-trees of the Neuhaus garden. But Fate was too strong
for her; the very morning fixed for their departure Madame de
Ruth slipped upon the castle staircase and broke her ankle.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine was informed of the accident by Zollern, who
was both distressed for the sake of his old friend's pain, and
much disturbed that the projected departure could not take
place, for he did not consider Wilhelmine safe in Stuttgart.
He knew that the feeling against her increased each day,
owing chiefly to the gossip concerning her witch practices. It
was her habit to read late at night, and the people believed
she was occupied in brewing magic philters and composing
incantations. They vowed they had seen two shadows on
her window-blinds, which of a truth they may have seen, for
often old Frau Hazzim came to visit her secretly at night.
The Jewess was entirely under the spell of Wilhelmine's
attraction, and the Gr&auml;venitz was learning many things from
her nocturnal visitor, who had a vast knowledge of herbs and
medicaments, the traditional code of doctoring handed down
in her family. Strict Jewess though she was, she had many
receipts for love potions, and she knew much of various
poisons. Thus the Stuttgarters were not mistaken when they
averred they had seen a second shadow on the blind, and
considering Frau Hazzim's grotesque features, it is hardly
surprising that the superstitious and fearful observers believed
that this second shadow was the witch's familiar spirit.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine's servants were questioned at the market, and
they replied that their mistress received no visitors in the
dead of night, for Wilhelmine was naturally careful that even
her servants should not be aware of Frau Hazzim's visits,
which, considering the ill fame of the Jews in those days, was
absolutely necessary. She therefore was wont herself to
admit her visitor by a small door which opened on to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>
garden at the back of the J&auml;gerhaus. So the terrified, fascinated
watchers saw, with horror, this mysterious second
shadow on the closed blind, and it was said that by incantations
the witch summoned this evil being, for her own
servants must know had any person from the mortal world
been in the house!</p>

<p>Of this story Zollern was not aware, but he knew enough
to recognise the dangerous reputation which his friend
enjoyed. Wilhelmine herself was perfectly conscious that
there was an element of danger for her, and she was disturbed
that by Madame de Ruth's untoward accident she
was obliged to remain in Stuttgart. That she was a
reputed witch she knew, but far from being alarmed she
was slightly flattered and amused at the notion, and
deeming herself secure in the Duke's powerful protection
she had no fear of any serious annoyance. Her only apprehension
was that some murderous attack might be made
upon her when she drove out, so she remained more than
ever secluded and hidden in the J&auml;gerhaus and the walled-in
Lustgarten, her one amusement being Frau Hazzim's nightly
visits.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine was half dupe of her own magical practices,
and she was arduous in her studies of old black-letter books
on the subject of spirit-raising, love potions, spells, and the
rest of those meddlings with the unknown forces which have
fascinated mankind for countless ages under various forms.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May the weather changed, and sultry
heat reigned over Wirtemberg. Stuttgart lies deep in a valley,
sheltered by hills, and the heat in the town is often terrible.
The sudden change from the chill spring to glowing summer
was unbearable to Wilhelmine, immured in the J&auml;gerhaus,
and she longed for the cool freshness of the Rothwald where
she had been accustomed to drive, but Zollern so strongly
advised her not to show herself in the town, that she consented
to forego this pleasure while M&uuml;ller was in Stuttgart.
He had preached before the Duchess, upon whom his passionate
eloquence, the Biblical turn of his phrases, and his
denunciations of all things joyful, had made a deep and
pleasing impression. She caused the Pietist to visit her daily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>
and instruct her in the stern belief. M&uuml;ller told her Highness
the story of his conversion: how he had been a worldly,
but he hoped a pure, pastor of the State religion; how that an
evil and lustful woman had sought to seduce him, and he
mentioned G&uuml;strow as the place where his temptation had
been offered him. The stroke told: her Highness started
visibly. He continued by indicating that this abandoned
woman was a witch, and finally let the Duchess understand
that, having triumphantly resisted the temptress's sinful wiles,
he had sought and found strength in the Pietist movement.
Even a slower intellect than that of Johanna Elizabetha could
not have failed to associate Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz with
the temptress of G&uuml;strow; and when in answer to her Highness's
query, whether the evil woman had been punished for
her wickedness, M&uuml;ller threw himself at the Duchess's feet
and told her openly that the contaminating female was the
Gr&auml;venitz, whom he had followed from G&uuml;strow&mdash;he, the poor
instrument of God's righteous wrath, her Highness indeed
felt that here was the vengeance of the Almighty coming
upon her enemy. M&uuml;ller was sincere enough in his abhorrence
of the woman who had resisted and then insulted him.
The fanatical practices of the Pietists had inflamed his mind,
and he really believed God had chosen him to humble the
wanton. Old Frau von Gr&auml;venitz had talked freely of the
favours and honours showered upon her daughter at Stuttgart,
and M&uuml;ller's mad physical jealousy was aroused, for he at
once realised that Wilhelmine had become Eberhard Ludwig's
mistress. This, together with his fierce fanatical Pietism, had
sufficed to turn the man's brain. Thus mixed and contending
motives, as is so often the case, formed a fixed and single
purpose, and M&uuml;ller had preached his way to Stuttgart,
where he meant to accomplish his object of vengeance upon
Wilhelmine or die in the attempt. He knew that to gain an
extensive hearing from the crowd in Stuttgart he must earn a
reputation as preacher in the neighbourhood, so he began his
campaign by lecturing in the open air at many towns and
villages of Wirtemberg. Pietism was rife all over the
country, and the preacher was received with enthusiasm, and
his fame, as we have seen, spread rapidly, even reaching at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
length the Duchess. M&uuml;ller had never dreamed of gaining
so great a personage as her Highness, and he was astounded
when he received her command to preach at the castle; but
this gave him renewed confidence in himself, and it seemed
to his half-crazy mind to be a confirmation of his divine
mission of revenge on the sinful. At present he had formed
no definite plan as to how his vengeance was to be accomplished;
he merely meant, if possible, to inflame public
opinion against Wilhelmine to such an extent as to cause
her to be driven from Wirtemberg. With unfailing energy
M&uuml;ller preached sometimes four or five sermons daily, whenever
and wherever he managed to attract a crowd. At first
he contented himself with pronouncing violent diatribes
against sin: the term conveyed to him only one species
of human weakness, and all his sermons were on the subject
of bodily lust. He had named Wilhelmine 'a sinner, an
instigator of wickedness,' at T&uuml;bingen, and he had quickly
noted the approval on his hearers' faces. Now in Stuttgart
he went further, and actually accused her of witchcraft as
well. His zeal grew, each day increased by his own words, till
he preached openly a religious crusade against her. Osiander,
informed of these sayings, caused him to be warned that the
Church could not countenance a religious preacher who thus
instigated the people to revolutionary acts. The better sort
of Pietists&mdash;sober burghers, for the most part&mdash;deserted their
idol, and his congregations were now chiefly composed of the
worst characters of the town. It certainly was unfortunate
that the Gr&auml;venitz had been unable to seek the shelter of
Neuhaus, yet Zollern and Stafforth reflected there could be
little actual danger if she remained at the J&auml;gerhaus, only
taking the air in the walled-in Lustgarten; but they urged her
not to venture out of this shelter for a few weeks, after the
expiration of which time they argued the popular excitement
would have died out, or if it had not, they would make arrangements
for her residence in some safe place across the frontier
of Switzerland. Neuhaus they considered to be too near to
T&uuml;bingen, where, they heard, there was much hostility against
Wilhelmine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile each day the heat became more intense, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
the Favourite grew more impatient of being forbidden to drive
out. One evening, as she sat disconsolately in her salon, a faint,
fresh breeze floated in through the open window. It was fragrant
and delightful after the long, stifling hours, and it seemed to
her like an invitation from the outer world, that world of tree
and flower for which she yearned. How she longed to drive
away out of the reeking, low-lying town, and wander in the
cool Red Wood! Still the Lustgarten was a resource, and its
quaint sixteenth- and seventeenth-century embellishments
delighted her. She rose, and taking a lace mantilla, arranged
it round her head. She passed out of the small door at the
back of the J&auml;gerhaus, and strolled slowly along in the
direction of the grotto. As she passed the gates leading from
the garden to the high-road, she called to the sentry, telling
him that should Monseigneur de Zollern seek her before she
returned, he should be informed that she had gone to the
Duke Christopher's Grotto. At first the soldier pretended
not to hear, and the Gr&auml;venitz was obliged to approach him
and give her message.</p>

<p>She asked, angrily, if he was deaf, and was informed in the
usual peasant idiom that he 'could hear as well as another.'</p>

<p>'Well, give my message to any one who inquires for me,'
she said haughtily, and walked on.</p>

<p>The man frowned evilly at her, and she recollected that
the maid Maria, once when she had accompanied her mistress
on a stroll in the Lustgarten, and they had passed the same
sentry, had told her that he was the lover of Johanna Elizabetha's
waiting-maid, the woman who had always been so
insolent to Wilhelmine at the castle. 'He would do me
harm, that lout, if he could,' Wilhelmine reflected as she
walked on, and the man's frowning face haunted her for a
time, but soon the freshness of the evening breeze and the
garden's beauty drove all unquiet thoughts from her mind.</p>

<p>She wandered slowly through the trees of the pheasant
garden, pausing a moment to look at the gorgeous plumage
of the birds in their gilded cages. Then she came to the
rosery shut off from the rest of the garden by tall beech-trees,
where splashed the fountain near the marble seat on which
the lovers had sat together after the theatricals, and where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
Eberhard Ludwig had agonised when she was hidden in the
Judengasse. She passed the new Lusthaus, and looked up
with a sigh at the balcony where Serenissimus and she had
stood together, and he had told her Forstner called him a
ridiculous poet fellow, because he loved the starlit woods at
night. She came to the famous fourteenth-century maze,
where the cypress-trees had grown so high and dense that it
was really a place to lose oneself in, did one not possess the
clue to the intricate windings. She walked outside the maze,
breathing in the fragrance of the sun-kissed cypress, and turned
into the orangery, and here she lingered a while in the alleys
of formally cut trees. Then she walked on, and finally gained
the wilderness which surrounded the famous grotto; this was
a long construction of rocks and shells, very quaint, no doubt,
in the days when it was built, yet Time had further enchanted
it, adding melancholy and mystery to the half-ruined place.
There was a deep, stagnant tank before the grotto, covered
with weeds and growing things. In the centre of this tank,
among lusty nymphs and playful dolphins, a huge Triton
sat on his rocky throne, and from his trident a few drops of
water still oozed slowly.</p>

<p>The elaborate waterworks and strange devices could not be
quite unhinged, Wilhelmine reflected idly. She recollected how
Eberhard Ludwig had shown her the grotto's marvellous springs
and tricks; she recalled how, after much heaving and turning
at an iron lever, the whole grotto had suddenly been converted
into a place of living waters. She wondered if the works
were still more rusty now; how sad a waste that this curious
old-world pleasantry should be allowed to rust to destruction.
Wilhelmine fell into a dream: if she were Duchess, she would
have the grotto repaired, not Time's handiwork disturbed;
the ferns, the lichen, the twining ivy should remain; the
wilderness should not be formalised; only the waterworks
should be renewed, and the old devices made perfect. There
should be water-f&ecirc;tes by moonlight, with lamps shimmering
through the playing fountains, and music, faint and fitful,
from unseen players. And she would be mistress of all this.</p>

<p>She was resting on a moss-grown seat, and the gentle breeze
played over her brow. She almost slept for a moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
What was that? A discordant note smote disagreeably on
her hearing. Why must the canaille make so hideous a noise
when it amuses itself? she reflected; probably some ridiculous
popular jaunt, some people's gathering. Her lip curled contemptuously.
Were she Duchess she would teach the canaille
what was fitting for it!</p>

<p>Again the sound disturbed her; it seemed to be coming
nearer&mdash;probably along the Bergstrasse from Cannstatt.
What could it be? She could hear the hoarse roar of
many voices; it was terrifying somehow. She sprang up.
God in Heaven! could it be a mob incited by M&uuml;ller to
stone her house? But no, the sound was not in that direction;
surely it came from beyond the eastern wall of the
Lustgarten. Impossible! But it sounded as though the
crowd made its way towards the grotto. The sound
increased each breathless moment; she could hear some of
the rabble singing hymns. To her horror she realised that
they must have passed the Lustgarten walls, that they were
actually nearing her. Could she gain the shelter of the
J&auml;gerhaus? She had a vision of a pursuit through the
gardens. No! she must hide&mdash;the mob must go past her,
that was her only hope. Instinct told her that she was the
crowd's quarry. Hide? But where? Ah, the grotto. She
fled round the water-tank and gained the humid darkness of
the grotto. She rushed on, her feet slipping on the slimy
stones of the entrance-chamber. If she could only gain the
higher gallery she might hide in some dark corner. Ah!
here were the steps. She clambered up; the yelling crowd
must be close behind now, for she could hear their words:
'Rat out the witch!' 'Death to the sinner!' 'Die Hexe! die
verdammte Hexe!'&mdash;then some coarse witticisms shouted in
Swabian dialect, rude laughter, whoops and curses, groans and
whistles, all a mob's animal-like ejaculations.</p>

<p>The Gr&auml;venitz shuddered. Would they pass her? They
were beneath the grotto now; she could hear their words distinctly:
'To the grotto! the grotto! the witch is there!
He told us she was going there!' Merciful Heaven! they
knew then&mdash;the sentry had told them! The Gr&auml;venitz felt
that all was lost now. They <i>must</i> find her. She crouched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>
down against the wall. Listen! What was that? 'The
grotto is haunted; the white lady walks there,' some one said.
They hesitated. She knew no one had entered the grotto yet.
'Nothing worse than a little water haunts the place, comrades,'
she heard a voice say, then laughter. A little water? What
had Eberhard Ludwig said? 'One might stand a siege here if
one turned the waters on from inside; I don't believe anything
but a sea-serpent could enter!'&mdash;idle words spoken in jest.
Was there a chance left? If she could find the lever&mdash;but it
would not turn&mdash;the hinges must be locked with rust. She
was seeking wildly along the wall now, her hands rasped and
bleeding with scraping against the rough surface. She remembered
Eberhard Ludwig had said, 'The trick of it is on
the left side of this gallery.' How the words came back to
her!&mdash;the left side. Yes! But which was the left side of the
grotto? She had lost her bearings in the darkness. Ah,
could this be it? She grasped it with both hands; it gave
slightly; she wrenched at it, throwing all her weight against
it. It resisted, and she felt as though her spine must crack
with the immense strain; the veins of her temples seemed
bursting, the tips of her fingers as though the blood must gush
out. Still the heavy, rusty iron bar only gave a little. She
could hear the noise outside, but it sounded faint to her, for
her entire bodily power was concentrated, and her ears only
registered the surging of her own blood. With a sudden
wrench the bar flew round in her hands, and she fell forward
on her knees, flung with her own impetus. Would the aged
mechanism respond? Was there more rust on the inner
wheels and springs? Ah! she could hear a gurgling and a
whirling of wheels. Yes! there came the water; she heard
the trickle, the splashing; then the whole grotto seemed
alive. She ran to a broken place in the outer wall of the
shell-and-stucco building; she crumbled off a shell which
impeded her vision. Now she could see the mob below,
though the rushing of the water deadened the voices, and she
could not distinguish the words. She saw two men come
tumbling out of the grotto, drenched and dripping objects.
She saw them gesticulating wildly, and guessed that they
were describing their reception in the water-cave. Even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
through the noise of the water she heard a roar of laughter
go up from those who had not penetrated the grotto. The
crowd's humour seemed changed; the men were no longer
fierce, they were amused, laughing. All crowds are curiously
fickle, easily aroused, easily appeased, and the Swabian
especially loves to be overreached by a joke. She saw
that the mob's attention was diverted from her, and she knew
that the danger was passed for the moment.</p>

<p>Would Zollern have been to the J&auml;gerhaus, have heard the
shouting, realised, and called out the guard to rescue her?
Would the waterworks fail and the rabble catch her, after
all? Or would the people grow bolder, face the water, and
hunt her out of her hiding-place? She listened intently,
but even if a detachment of cavalry had been on the way,
she could have heard nothing save the noisy merriment below
her and the splashing water in the cave. Was that a sword-blade
flashing in the distance? Yes, thank God! she could
see the outer rows of rioters looking anxiously towards where
she had seen the glint of steel through the trees. The crowd
suddenly dispersed for the most part, men ran hither and
thither aimlessly, but a knot of several hundreds remained
together, grown hostile again at the approach of hostility.
Sitting stiffly on his horse was Zollern, riding at the head of the
cavalry beside the captain of the Silver Guard. Monsieur de
Zollern reined in his horse before the mob, commanding
silence with a wave of his hand. The crowd toned down,
though there were still a few angry murmurs.</p>

<p>'What do you in his Highness's Lustgarten?' said Zollern
in a stern, clear voice, strangely unlike his usual quiet and
courtly tones. A confused murmur ran through the crowd.
'Answer, or we shall ride you down,' he said.</p>

<p>A few voices responded sullenly: 'We seek a witch,' and
again an ominous growl went up from the crowd.</p>

<p>'Learn that the Duke's Lustgarten is no place for you to
seek a witch,' thundered the old man. 'There are no witches
here or in any of his Highness's domains. And if you dare
to molest a friend of the Duke's, you shall be massacred
without mercy! I give you time to remove yourselves from
this garden, while I count ten; one, two,' he counted. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
the word 'ten' the guard charged upon the wavering mass of
humanity, which fled before the troopers' swords.</p>

<p>'Y &ecirc;tes-vous vraiment, Mademoiselle?' he called, but the
Gr&auml;venitz from the gallery's higher level could see that the
mob was not yet entirely driven from the garden, and she
dared not reply.</p>

<p>Zollern guessed that were she in truth hidden in the grotto,
she would prefer to postpone her exit until she could appear
without being seen by the soldiers, who were returning from
chasing the intruders. When the captain of the guard rode
up to Zollern he requested him to withdraw his men, adding
that it was unprecedented insolence for the rabble to have
dared to break into his Highness's Lustgarten. It struck the
old courtier that the captain's answer was but half-hearted.
Was even the guard infected with hostility against the
Gr&auml;venitz?</p>

<p>'The insolence to dare seek a witch here!' said Zollern,
scrutinising the captain's face closely.</p>

<p>'Witchcraft should be punished wherever it hides, Monseigneur,'
returned the captain gravely.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, if it <i>exists</i>, M. le Capitaine,' replied Zollern;
'but I beg you draw off your men; I will remain here and rest.'</p>

<p>At this moment Zollern realised that the Gr&auml;venitz must
be conveyed out of the country immediately; the guard itself
was not trustworthy where she was concerned. He watched
the soldiers till they passed out of sight, and then he reapproached
the grotto.</p>

<p>'Answer me now if you are indeed there, Mademoiselle;
I am alone,' he called, and he heard Wilhelmine's voice from
within, but owing to the rushing waters her words were indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wilhelmine was struggling to draw back the
lever, for she could not leave the grotto before the water
subsided. It was no easy matter to turn the heavy bar,
though the resistance was not so great as when she had
turned on the defending streams, still it lasted several
minutes ere she accomplished her task and heard the splashing
and gurgling of the water subside. Thus Zollern concluded
he had been mistaken when he had fancied he heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
her voice within, and when Wilhelmine reached the doorway
of the grotto he was preparing to depart.</p>

<p>She called him softly: 'Oh, my friend, help me home,' and
there was a tone of appeal in her voice. Zollern came to her
quickly, and raising her torn and bleeding hands to his lips,
kissed them tenderly. 'Guard me, protect me, Monseigneur.
I am very lonely,' she said.</p>

<p>'Until death takes me I will be your friend,' he replied,
and Madame de Ruth would have suffered a jealous pang had
she heard.</p>

<p>With a feeling of unreality, as though she were just
awakened from an evil dream, Wilhelmine found herself
once more in her pretty yellow-hung saloon. Maria, the
maid, kneeled beside her, bathing the wounds in her palms
made by the rough surface of the grotto walls. Slime from
the moss-grown stones was on Wilhelmine's dress, and deep
red marks of rust from the waterworks' lever had stained the
breast of her gown where she had pressed on the bar.</p>

<p>Zollern stood before her. He was urging her immediate
departure from Stuttgart; the place was unsafe for her in
the Duke's absence, he averred. The Gr&auml;venitz responded
wearily. She was willing to depart&mdash;indeed it was impossible
for her to remain&mdash;but whither? G&uuml;strow? Zollern reflected.
He owned a small castle at Schaffhausen in Switzerland, and
he begged her to accept it as a refuge. 'And I pray you,' he
added, 'keep it always if it pleases you; we never know when
a humble refuge may not be welcome.' And so it was decided
that Wilhelmine was to depart immediately, accompanied to
the frontier by a hundred guards commanded by a certain
Captain Schrader, whom Zollern knew he could trust, because
this officer was anxious to make his way at court by pleasing
the Duke.</p>

<p>The dawn was breaking through the deep blue of the night
sky when Wilhelmine started on her journey to Schaffhausen.
The cavalcade rattled down the Graben, Wilhelmine's heavy
coach in the midst of the famous Silver Guard. They passed
out of the town-gate and gained the open country, where
the fields sent forth a fragrant breath, and the woods were
pungent, sweet, and fresh from the cool night. It reminded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
Wilhelmine of that May morning a twelvemonth since, when
she had entered Wirtemberg, and yet, though Nature smiled
then as on that day, how different it had seemed to her.
Then everything had been radiant with Spring happiness,
and her heart had responded gladly, though she was but a
solitary stranger venturing into an unknown country. Now
she felt half angry with the woods and fields for their peaceful
joyousness, and her soul gave forth no answering note of
gladness, though she rode at ease in a fine coach surrounded
by a brilliant escort as though she were a queen. Her
thoughts were bitter, poisoned with disgust, for she realised
that, in spite of her great prosperity, she was in truth a
fugitive before 'la canaille,' and, as she journeyed, she took
no pleasure in the gracious loveliness around her. Her mind
was busy with plans for revenge upon the brutal mob and the
hostile burghers who thus drove her forth, and she vowed to
herself that her enemies should repent their insolence, that
the canaille should weep tears of blood and tremble before her
they had insulted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE MOCK MARRIAGE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mar&eacute;chal le Duc de Villars</span> was no brilliant, victorious
hero, judged by the standard of a century which had seen
such military geniuses as Turenne, as the great Cond&eacute;, as
Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy. Villars was essentially a
wily tactician, and his exploits were useful, but he lacked the
dash, the verve which characterise the great commanders of
that epoch. It was his system to overrun an invaded country,
skilfully avoiding actual combat with the defending army,
which pursued him impotently along the ghastly trail of
ravage. Thus Villars, with no loss to his troops, spread
famine through the land, for he plundered and devastated
wherever he passed. He conducted the brief invasion of
Wirtemberg in 1707 on these lines. Crossing the Rhine
during the night of May 21st, he plunged unopposed
into the very heart of the Swabian land. Eberhard Ludwig,
who, along with the Elector of Hanover, commanded one
portion of the Imperial army, executed a turning movement
mighty like a retreat, but Villars had so overpowering
a majority of men that an attack upon their united
strength would have been more than hazardous. Thus the
whole country lay at the Frenchmen's mercy, and they
swarmed over town, village, and farm, harrying, burning,
pillaging, and always disappearing ere the would-be defenders
came up. Eberhard Ludwig followed hotly, hoping to engage
separate columns of the huge army, but it was too late, and
after a futile pursuit round the entire country, he had the
chagrin of seeing the French enter Stuttgart. Here Villars
remained but a few days. Wilhelmine said afterwards that
'l'ennui de Stuttgard' had proved a greater defence than the
entire Imperial army! Be this as it may, Villars evacuated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>
Stuttgart in an amazingly short time, and retired eastwards to
the ancient town of Schorndorf. Now the Duchess-mother
emerged from her dower-house at Stetten, and craved a meeting
with the Duc de Villars, who, as a gentleman, could not
refuse the ancient dame's request.</p>

<p>There is a popular tradition that they met in a field
between Schorndorf and Stetten, neither being willing to
accept the hospitality of the other, and that here they discussed
and settled the terms of the evacuation of Wirtemberg
and the sum of the indemnity, all of which was afterwards
solemnly ratified by the Geheimraths of Stuttgart, who, willingly,
permitted the Duchess-mother to bear nearly the entire
cost of the indemnity, a matter of some two hundred thousand
gulden. Villars, upon payment of this sum, half of which he
is reported by German historians to have retained for his own
uses, now left Wirtemberg, and marched towards the French
frontier, leaving, however, six thousand men under General
Vivant in the country.</p>

<p>The Imperial army under command of the Elector of
Hanover was at Heilbronn in Wirtemberg, a medi&aelig;val Imperial
free town. Eberhard Ludwig, in command of the Wirtemberg
contingent, was with the army. His Highness had taken up
his quarters in the ancient Abbey of Maulbronn, between
which and Heilbronn spread the encampment of the Imperial
army. Eberhard Ludwig had chosen Maulbronn for his
quarters, thinking that the peace of the Monastery, with its
shadowy, highly vaulted cloisters, and its old-world garden,
might soothe the restlessness which had devoured his being
since his absence from Wilhelmine. In Maulbronn's garden
stands the haunted tower where legend says that Doctor
Faustus, the frenzied searcher for the elixir of eternal life,
bartered his soul to Satan in return for a span of youth and
love. The Faust tower faces the great cloister, and they say
the Doctor, when sealing his pact with the devil, was disturbed
by the monks' chanting.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig revelled in the garden and its fantastic
legends, but his yearning for Wilhelmine only grew the
stronger. Why was she not with him to dream in the cool
silence of the cloister? How she would love the garden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
with its luxuriance of old-world flowers&mdash;the fragrant
roses planted by some long-dead monk&mdash;the huge tree-peonies.
The very breezes seemed legend-laden. Wilhelmine!
beloved! It was a futile thing indeed for this poet-prince to
endeavour to forget the woman he loved! In a garden so
wondrous beautiful, in this place of dreaming, he could but
dream the more. So, when the news came that Villars had
retired, his Highness decided he must follow Wilhelmine to
Switzerland forthwith. Forstner was summoned, and the
Wirtemberg troops placed under his command. Of course
he protested he was not efficient, but, as usual, Eberhard
Ludwig the impetuous overruled him.</p>

<p>The news of his Highness's departure caused angry consternation
in Stuttgart. Johanna Elizabetha wept, but the
Duchess-mother raged. She had fancied that her son, deeply
obliged to her for her generous action of the war indemnity,
would listen to her reasonable voice as a reward.</p>

<p>'Ridiculous!' <i>he</i> argued. 'I never asked her to pay the
indemnity; if she chooses to do so, well and good, but it does
not bind me to obedience.'</p>

<p>There is a pathetic letter from the Duchess-mother to her
son, a dignified epistle with a very human postscriptum,
wherein bubbles over a mother's hatred for her son's seducer,
the honest woman's furious disdain of the triumphant charm
of an adventuress.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'<span class="smcap">Mon Fils</span>,&mdash;Si j'ai d&eacute;livr&eacute; le pays du fl&eacute;au fran&ccedil;ois j'attends
que vous d&eacute;livriez la Cour du fl&eacute;au de votre p&eacute;ch&eacute;. Revenez
&agrave; Stuttgard et faites votre devoir de mari, de p&egrave;re, de fils et
de Prince Chr&eacute;tien. Vous redonnerez la paix &agrave; votre m&egrave;re,</p></div>

<p class="figcenter">
'<span class="smcap">Magdal&egrave;ne Sybille, Princesse de Hesse Darmstadt,<br />
'Duchesse Douairi&egrave;re de Wirtemberg.</span>
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Cette Gr&auml;venitz est une p&mdash;&mdash;! J'aurois des preuves si
je voulois les donner; je vous prie de me croire qu'elle ne
m&eacute;rite pas votre faveur!'</p></div>

<p>Possibly, had the Duchess-mother denied herself the satisfaction
of writing this postscriptum, Eberhard Ludwig might
indeed have returned to Stuttgart for a time, and who can tell
how a man's fancy may vary in a few months? But being a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>
lover and a chivalrous gentleman, the unfortunate paragraph
roused him to a white heat of championship for his mistress.
What! she 'une p&mdash;&mdash;?' Ah! how evil was the world! No
man, and, above all, no woman, could understand Wilhelmine.
She was grossly misjudged, cruelly persecuted. Thus, when
he read this letter from his mother (which reached him when
he was starting for Switzerland), he only shrugged his shoulders
angrily, and crushing the missive into his saddle holster,
spurred his horse forward, and galloped southward to the
calumniated lady of his heart.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine had passed a solitary two months at Schaffhausen.
Zollern's castle stood on the left bank of the Rhine,
overlooking the great waterfall, whose delicious thunder had
soothed her to calmer thoughts. She passed the long hours
in reading and making music, and the peaceful days had added
brilliancy to her splendid healthfulness. Thus, when Eberhard
Ludwig came to Schaffhausen, he found her an even more
forceful, vital, fresh-skinned woman than had been the beautiful
girl he left at Stuttgart.</p>

<p>She met him with passionate happiness, and for a few days
their intercourse was a prolonged rhapsody of the senses.
At length, however, their dream was broken by the unwelcome
advent of a messenger with despatches from Vienna to Field-Marshal
of the Imperial Army, Commander of the Swabian
Army Corps, Monseigneur le Duc de Wirtemberg. His Highness
was furious, also anxious. Why had the fool Forstner
not attended to these despatches? They were important commands
concerning the army, and needed immediate attention,
and now, having been all the way to Heilbronn, here they
were sent to Switzerland! His Highness fumed, cursed
Forstner; it was exceedingly awkward, orders from Vienna,
and Eberhard Ludwig in Switzerland. He had given full
power to Forstner to transact all business in his name.</p>

<p>'Of course, a plot,' said Wilhelmine, 'a plot to separate us
again!'</p>

<p>His Highness was anxious, but she soothed him as usual,
and he sent the despatches back with orders to Forstner to
attend to the business. Peace again for a day or so, then
Forstner arrived at Schaffhausen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>
'Why in hell's name do you follow me, M. de Forstner?'
was the Duke's greeting.</p>

<p>'I come because it is my duty, Monseigneur!'</p>

<p>'Your duty? Let me remind you that your duty lies where
I left you&mdash;with the army. But now that you have come, kindly
tell me your errand.' It was harshly said, and Forstner was
deeply wounded. Could this be the noble, courteous prince
he had served for many years, the friend of his childhood,
the gallant companion in arms? Poor Forstner, he had yet
to discover that the tiresome friend is always ill-treated
eventually.</p>

<p>'My errand, Monseigneur, will be unwelcome to you, I
know, for I have come to urge you to return to the army
immediately. The Elector of Hanover is furious at your Highness's
sudden departure. He says openly that it is contrary to
both military discipline and, I regret, mon Prince, to honour.
He says if all his generals permitted themselves to run after
their mistresses when it suited them, the army would be in a
parlous state.' Indeed the Elector of Hanover had expressed
himself in less measured words.</p>

<p>'I am a Prince commanding my own troops allied with the
Imperial army, and I am at liberty to go and come without permission
from M. l'Electeur,' said Eberhard Ludwig haughtily.</p>

<p>'I implore your Highness to listen to reason,' cried Forstner;
'you are jeopardising your reputation as a soldier for the
sake of a &mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The epithet he used was forcible, and Eberhard Ludwig
started forward angrily.</p>

<p>'Yes, it is the task of a true friend to speak the truth
without reserve' (alas, Forstner!), 'and Mademoiselle de
Gr&auml;venitz is an abandoned woman.' As he uttered these
words Wilhelmine entered the apartment.</p>

<p>'Mon Prince, is it thus you permit your friends to speak
of me?' she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>'A thousand times no!' cried his Highness. 'Forstner, you
leave my service for ever. Go!' He pointed dramatically
to the door, but Forstner had not concluded his peroration,
and he had no intention of being silenced this time; he was
a diligent, persistent friend, poor soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
'Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz, I appeal to you; his Highness
is playing a ridiculous r&ocirc;le in the sight of Europe! Give him
up, send him back to duty, to honour, to his great military
career!'</p>

<p>'Monsieur, you come here to dictate to his Highness, it
seems! Since when is that your right?' She spoke sneeringly,
and Eberhard Ludwig felt that her taunt was directed
in part at himself. She did not deem him capable of resisting
Forstner, perhaps? she considered him as a being whose
conduct could be dictated.</p>

<p>'I know my duty, sir,' he said; 'you have no need to teach
it me.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, Monseigneur, you have forgotten it since yonder
lady's advent!' Forstner was getting beyond himself.</p>

<p>'I have not forgotten how to defend from insult the lady
whom I love and honour,' said Eberhard Ludwig coldly, 'and I
request you, Forstner, to withdraw immediately.'</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz, you have ruined his Highness!'
shouted Forstner; 'he is untrue to all his vows: you
are a &mdash;&mdash;'; but his words are unrepeatable, even Wilhelmine
shrank back. Eberhard Ludwig drew his sword and forced his
over-zealous friend through the door.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards his Highness returned and, flinging
himself upon his knees before the Gr&auml;venitz, poured forth a
torrent of adoring words, but the lady remained impervious to
his pleading.</p>

<p>'I cannot suffer such treatment,' she answered; 'I can but
beg your Highness to depart from me for ever. I shall reside
here, drag out a solitary existence in this refuge which my
friend Monseigneur de Zollern has given me! Your Highness
cannot defend me from insult, and I do not choose to be flaunted
as a wanton.'</p>

<p>'Alas, what can I do? I will give you all, but I have not
the power to legalise your position.'</p>

<p>'So I see, Monseigneur, and therefore I beg you to depart.'</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine, do you love me? Alas! alas!'</p>

<p>'I love you, mon Prince, but these taunts are unbearable.
I have no one to protect me&mdash;you cannot, for you yourself are
the cause of all the indignities heaped upon me.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>'Ah, would that I could make you Duchess, my wife, safe
from insult!'</p>

<p>'You dare not, though other princes have had the courage
thus to shield those they loved.'</p>

<p>'I dare not? I? God! who shall tell me that I dare not?'
he cried.</p>

<p>'You dare not,' she answered, and again as she swept from the
room, over her shoulder she flung scornfully: 'You dare not!'</p>

<hr />

<p>In the panelled living-room of the Neuhaus, on the morning
of the 29th July 1707, Madame de Ruth and her peasant
servant were busying themselves with a large table and a
heap of silken hangings. The lady was draping the table
with these, and her efforts had caused her highly piled-up
head-dress to become deranged; the elaborate structure leaned
on one side and scattered a shower of powder over Madame
de Ruth's shoulders. The servant interrupted his work of
hammering nails into the draped silk on the table; he stared
at his mistress and grinned. 'Go on, stupid head, and
never mind an old woman's hairdress,' she said good-humouredly.
'I shall be fine enough this afternoon, and so
wilt thou, for I shall give thee a new coat.' She rose from
her knees and surveyed her handiwork. Taking a large
bowl filled with roses, she placed it upon the table, then
she went to a cupboard and began to hunt through its
varied contents. She sought a Bible, and indeed it was
the first time in her life that she had searched the
Scriptures, as she reflected grimly. She had a dim recollection
of having seen a worn Bible consorting oddly with
the other books in that cupboard. After some time she
found the Bible and placed it upon the silk-draped table.
She stood a moment absent-mindedly, gazing from the window
at the sunlight playing through the delicate tracery in the
beech branches without, her hands mechanically turning over
the leaves of the Bible. Suddenly her fingers touched something
between the pages, something that crumbled away
beneath her touch, a withered flower, the faded, brittle ghost
of some vanished summer day. She drew away her hand
quickly as though the flower stung her. It had conjured up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span>
the long-past loss and sorrow of a day when she had given
birth to a child and Death came hurrying to gather the little
life. Madame de Ruth remembered how eagerly she had
read in the Book of Life during the sad hours of her recovery,
seeking wildly, miserably for consolation, and she recalled
how the kind old peasant woman, who nursed and mourned
with her for the baby's loss, had brought her a flower which
bloomed near the piteously small mound beneath which the
little one slept for ever. And Madame de Ruth had laid the
blossom tenderly between the Bible's pages, and now, after
long years of forgetful gaiety and dissipation, the yearning,
unsatisfied motherhood welled up in her heart and she wept
again.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once more we are in the panelled room at Neuhaus, and
again is assembled the company which on that portentous
November evening of the preceding year had discussed the
plan of summoning Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz, she who was
to be their tool in an ordinary court intrigue. Madame de
Ruth, the hostess; Monseigneur de Zollern; Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz,
since a few days become Count of the Empire; Marie
Gr&auml;venitz, his bigoted Catholic wife; Monsieur the Hofmarshal
Stafforth.</p>

<p>'It is madness, rank lunacy!' Stafforth was saying vehemently.
'Illegal and impossible, it will spell disgrace and
misfortune to us all. The Emperor will interfere, for this is
going too far. We must hinder this farcical ceremony; his
Highness cannot marry two wives! It will be M&ouml;mpelgard
over again! Think how absurd, Gr&auml;venitz! Cannot you see
that this farce is bigamy?'</p>

<p>Count Gr&auml;venitz held his hands over his brow. 'I agree
with you, Monsieur de Stafforth. My sister goes too far. It
is very hard on me; I advised her to be satisfied with a
settled annuity, and to live peacefully with me, her brother,
the head of her house. His Highness can always visit her&mdash;a
great honour indeed&mdash;&mdash;' He broke off, seeing the sneer
on Monseigneur de Zollern's face.</p>

<p>'I wash my hands of the whole affair!' cried Gr&auml;venitz
distractedly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
'Ce cher Pilate,' murmured Zollern. Madame de Ruth
laughed.</p>

<p>'Gr&auml;venitz, your sister will be Duchess, never fear!
Marie, she will befriend the Holy Church in Wirtemberg.'
Madame de Ruth addressed herself to Marie Gr&auml;venitz, but it
was Zollern whom she observed as she spoke. 'Stafforth, you
will become a Count; and for myself, I shall see the last of
her Dull Highness from Baden. That is <i>my</i> reward.' She
laughed, but no responsive gaiety came from the rest of the
company. Indeed, the intrigue had assumed proportions
which alarmed Wilhelmine's allies. Her brother had learned
to fear her&mdash;he was jealous of her now. Stafforth, having been
foolish enough to incur her displeasure by tactless amorous
advances, feared that once her position became unassailable
she would cause him to be dismissed from court. Marie
Gr&auml;venitz was horrified at the idea of her sister-in-law's great
success; she said it was sinful. Poor soul, she was very
jealous. Zollern, however, regarded the strange marriage
with favour. He foresaw the complications ahead, and intended
to steer for a happy landing of the Prince and his new
bride on the eternal shores of Roman Catholicism. The
Pope would declare Eberhard Ludwig's former alliance with
Johanna Elizabetha to be null and void, and, in return, the
Duchy of Wirtemberg would be gathered back to the Holy
Church.</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth alone rejoiced honestly in the brilliant
ending of the 'great intrigue,' and if there was another
thought in her mind, it was delight at the discomfiture of the
dull Duchess; but chiefly the old courtesan was happy that
this honour befell her friend. She had conceived a real
affection for Wilhelmine.</p>

<p>Zollern tapped his cane on the parquet floor, rhythmically,
persistently. To Madame de Ruth the tapping sound
seemed to beat on her brain, and she put out her hand
imploring silence. 'How gay, my friends!' she exclaimed;
'really, we owe our friend a little merriment on her wedding
day!'</p>

<p>'I do not think I can permit my sister to go through this
marriage ceremony. It would show a nicer spirit towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
me, the head of her house, if she considered the difficulties
she may land me in&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Bont&eacute; divine! Gr&auml;venitz, what foolishness!' said Madame
de Ruth sharply. 'If you could manage to forget your own
important existence for a time&mdash;&mdash;' She was interrupted by
the entry of a personage of clerical appearance. Madame de
Ruth rose to greet the new arrival. 'Hochw&uuml;rden,' she said
in German, 'you received my letter? and you are ready to
do as I require&mdash;ask no questions and marry a couple, you
may know who, but on that head silence until your testimony
is necessary; and then you are prepared to swear you have
married them in all legal and religious form? In return a
hundred gulden, and I undertake also to have the Pfarrhaus
repaired. Is that well? yes?&mdash;well, let me present you:
Monseigneur de Zollern you have the honour to know already;
M. le Comte de Gr&auml;venitz, Madame la Comtesse, M. de
Stafforth, may I present to you Herr Pfahler, Pastor of the
Lutheran Church at Aalendorf?'</p>

<p>The man bowed deeply to each in turn. Marie Gr&auml;venitz
scarcely acknowledged his salute for fear of endangering her
Catholic soul by intercourse with a Protestant pastor.</p>

<p>'Now, Herr Pastor, are those arrangements complete? See
here, I have draped you an altar. Oh! unnecessary, you say,
for a Lutheran marriage? I regret, enfin&mdash;so much prettier,
hein? Well, you can stand before it to marry our friends,
it will not affect you! Then, here are two cushions for them
to kneel on; a Bible, pen, and paper for the legal documents.
Yes, is that all? Well, I may now call our friends,' and she
rustled out of the room.</p>

<p>A constrained silence fell on the four occupants of the
apartment. The Pastor who had followed after Madame
de Ruth to don his black 'talar,' the clerical gown of the
Lutheran divine, returned and took up his position before
the altar table. He busied himself turning over the leaves
of the Bible, and the faded flower fluttered out and fell
on to one of the cushions prepared for the bride and
bridegroom. The door opened and Eberhard Ludwig, Duke
of Wirtemberg, entered the room. He bowed gravely to the
assembled company, then moved forward and stood facing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
Pfahler before the improvised altar. The guests had risen
at his Highness's entry. The silence was intense. Of a
sudden a huge black form bounded through the window.
Marie Gr&auml;venitz screamed shrilly, and the Herr Pastor started
violently.</p>

<p>'It is only my dog, Madame,' said his Highness. 'He has
found me after all. I left him locked up in my sleeping-room.
Here, M&eacute;lac, lie down! quiet! good dog!' he called, and the
wolf-hound obediently stretched himself beside the Duke.</p>

<p>'I thought it was the devil,' Marie Gr&auml;venitz whimpered.</p>

<p>'The devil, Madame, come to attend these espousals,' remarked
Stafforth with a sneer.</p>

<p>'Silence, Monsieur,' said his Highness haughtily; and once
more a brooding stillness fell on the company, broken only
by M&eacute;lac's heavy breathing, and the flutter of the Bible's
pages between the Pastor's nervous fingers. Would the
bride never come? this waiting was intolerable. Eberhard
Ludwig stood stern and silent, his hand resting on his rapier's
hilt. At length there came the swish of silken garments
rasping over the rough wooden boards of the corridor floor.
Once more the door was flung open, and Wilhelmine von
Gr&auml;venitz stood on the threshold. She looked like some
lavish flower of a tropic clime, a gorgeous white blossom,
surrounded by rich golden outer petals. Her gown was of
the delicate yellow colour which she loved, and her bare
breast was creamy white, and showing the blue tracery of the
veins through the fine skin. From her shoulders fell a heavy
white brocade cloak, trimmed with ermine like the coronation
robe of a queen. Her hair was powdered and piled high on
her head, the towering masses adding height to her great
stature. She looked a queen among women, a glorious
figure of youth and majesty, and it was little wonder that
Eberhard Ludwig was enthralled.</p>

<p>'Dressed as a royal princess already!' spitefully whispered
Stafforth to Marie Gr&auml;venitz, who looked at her radiant sister-in-law
with envy written on her narrow face.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig came forward, bowed profoundly before
his bride, and led her towards the altar. The Pastor stared
in astonishment when he saw the woman he had undertaken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
to marry to his Prince, for he recognised the traveller he had
met at T&uuml;bingen. The stranger's face had haunted his dreams.</p>

<p>And now the brief ceremony commenced. The Pastor,
evidently nervous, mumbled his words indistinctly; and
of a truth, no one of the assembled company paid much
heed to the sermon and prayers, for each was busy with
thoughts of personal ambition and intrigue, excepting Marie
Gr&auml;venitz, whose lips moved rapidly in prayer that she might
be forgiven for taking part in an heretical rite. Madame de
Ruth watched Wilhelmine with adoring eyes; perchance she
dreamed this beautiful woman to be her child returned to
her. Poor mite, who slept forgotten in its tiny grave&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>'May the blessing of God rest upon you, and may God
enable you to keep sacred the vows you have made this day,'
concluded the Pastor, and the bride and bridegroom rose from
their knees.</p>

<p>'I have the honour to present to you Madame la Comtesse
d'Urach, which title I hereby confer upon my beloved wife,
pending the bestowal of the first title of my Dukedom, which
I shall hope to be able to offer to my wife in a few months'
time. Meanwhile, I beg you, my friends, of your good feeling,
to pay the same respects and courtesies to the Countess of
Urach as you, so kindly, pay to myself.'</p>

<p>Up jumped Madame de Ruth and kissed Wilhelmine on
both cheeks, then sank to the ground before her in a deep
courtesy; but the other friends hung back, save Zollern, who
came forward and, bowing over the bride's hand, remarked:
'To every beautiful woman should be rendered homage.'
It was an adroit compromise, half reminder, half graceful,
tactful compliment, for naturally a Prince of his house could
not be expected to pay royal honours to any Countess of
Urach&mdash;or even Duchess of Wirtemberg, save from courtesy
or worldly wisdom. Stafforth, the adventurer, had an ugly
sneer on his countenance, and was evidently embarrassed, so
took refuge in the frequent attitude of the vulgar when ill at
ease&mdash;a noisy jocularity.</p>

<p>'Ha! ha!' he laughed boisterously, 'and now for the
wedding feast! Bride and bridegroom, come along&mdash;and
we'll have a song to cheer us!'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz, full of fictitious emotion, was kissing
his sister's hand repeatedly, and making little speeches to
her, the beauty of which moved him almost to tears; though
when he saw no one was admiring him, he retired in aggrieved
silence, thinking 'What a bad spirit these people show towards
me!'</p>

<p>Marie Gr&auml;venitz stiffly congratulated her sister-in-law, and
pressed a meagre cheekbone against Wilhelmine's glowing
face; she called this a kiss. Pfahler bowed before the bride:
'I have had the honour to meet your Highness,'&mdash;Wilhelmine
started, Zollern tapped with his stick impatiently&mdash;'to meet
your Highness before&mdash;one day at T&uuml;bingen; but your Highness
could not recollect. I had no idea then that I was
speaking with so exalted a lady.'</p>

<p>'Nor were you then,' said Wilhelmine with that bright
humorous smile of hers; 'but indeed, Hochw&uuml;rden, I do
remember, and I recollect how you told me of the history of
master races cradled in the Swabian hills.'</p>

<p>'I have assisted to-day at a great historic scene. May a
new race of strong men and princes arise herefrom!' said
Pfahler, the historic dreamer.</p>

<p>'Umph! ces bourgeois h&eacute;r&eacute;tiques ne savent jamais trouver
le juste milieu,' growled Zollern to Madame de Ruth.</p>

<p>Now his Highness became impatient, the embarrassment
of the scene seemed to grow each moment. 'A thousand
thanks, dear friend,' he said, turning to Madame de Ruth, 'a
thousand thanks for all you have done for us, but we must
leave you now. Come, bid us God-speed!' He led the way
from the panelled room to the house door, before which stood
a chaise de poste with six horses, which the three postillions
restrained with difficulty. Dressed in his fine new coat, the
peasant servant of Neuhaus stood grinning in the background.</p>

<p>'Come, Madame!' called his Highness. Wilhelmine
sprang into the chaise, and Madame de Ruth, perilously
balanced on the step, wrapped a white lace mantilla round
the bride. The horses bounded forward, and, urged by the
postillions, raced away at a hand gallop.</p>

<p>This was the first of that furious driving with which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
favourite, in after years, habitually dashed through the
country. It was one of the causes of her unpopularity with
the peasants; they cursed her and her wild horses. 'Why
such haste to do the devil's work?' they muttered; and
they cursed the dust which the chariot left, as the hated
Gr&auml;venitzin thundered through the villages.</p>

</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> their marriage his Highness and the Countess of
Urach took up their residence in the castle of Hohen-T&uuml;bingen,
where Wilhelmine had wandered, a lonely stranger,
on the morning of her arrival in Wirtemberg. Now she was
the queen of the grim fortress, and, looking upon the fair
valley and the distant hills, she would often ponder on the
marvellous workings of her destiny.</p>

<p>The court of Wirtemberg naturally held aloof from the
unlawful magnificence at T&uuml;bingen, and her Ladyship of
Urach realised that she must form a circle of her own, so
she summoned her family from the north.</p>

<p>Her sister, Emma Sittmann, came from Berlin accompanied
by her husband, the merchant's warehouse clerk, who
it was said, had been at one time hairdresser to a Countess
of Wartensleben, and had been dismissed for his insolence.
A cousin came with the Sittmanns, Sch&uuml;tz by name, a shady
attorney who had been discredited for sharp practices in
various towns, including Vienna, where, however, he still
retained business relations of a mysterious and probably
reprehensible character. A number of friends and relations,
both of Sch&uuml;tz's and Sittmann's, also hastened to T&uuml;bingen.
Sittmann had been married once before he took Wilhelmine's
sister to wife, and of this former union he had two gawky
sons, who accompanied their father and stepmother to this
land of promise.</p>

<p>Old Frau von Gr&auml;venitz was invited by her successful
daughter to repair to Wirtemberg but the harsh old lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
responded by a bluff refusal and a command to Wilhelmine
to return to virtue. She never visited Wirtemberg, and
though she condescended to receive small sums from Friedrich
Gr&auml;venitz, regardless of the fact that the money actually
came from Wilhelmine, she remained sternly disapproving to
the end of her days.</p>

<p>It was but a small court, and Wilhelmine found it all
insufficient, so she selected from among the T&uuml;bingen students
half a dozen youths of undistinguished birth but undoubted
intelligence, and caused them to be given minor court
appointments. Stafforth was dismissed; his wife was
Johanna Elizabetha's friend, and the Countess disliked him.
Knowing him for an unscrupulous adventurer himself, she
judged him capable of gauging the small social standing and
slightly veneered vulgarity of Sittmann, Sch&uuml;tz and company.
So Stafforth's Oberhofmarshall's baton was conferred on
Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz, together with a considerable income.
Sittmann was made a baron (of Wirtemberg, not of the
Empire); Sch&uuml;tz became Geheimrath and personal secretary
to his Highness; Madame de Ruth was Oberhofmeisterin&mdash;'Dame
de D&eacute;shonneur,' Wilhelmine called her in private&mdash;and
the two ladies laughed much at the recollection of this,
poor Johanna Elizabetha's solitary witticism. The Sittmann
was Dame du Palais, her stepsons were Kammerjunker
(equerries) to the Duke. Pages were chosen from among the
younger T&uuml;bingen students, and any chance visitor was given
a high-sounding title and a sham office. The only work of
the whole heterogeneous collection was to be gorgeously
attired; but this was easy, as the Duke paid all expenses; to
be young and gay, or you were even permitted to be old,
could you be witty; and before every other duty came the
obligation of treating the Countess of Urach with all the
ceremony and adulation which the world is accustomed to
offer to queens.</p>

<p>The Duke's own guard was commanded to T&uuml;bingen, and
so much silver was added to their uniforms that the regiment
now thoroughly earned its appellation of Silver Guard.
Many T&uuml;bingen students were enrolled in the corps; indeed,
it was imperative there should be a leaven of Wilhelmine's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
adherents in the troop, for Zollern said that he did not trust
the old guard where she was concerned.</p>

<p>An erstwhile strolling company of Italian comedians was
installed as court play-actors; a number of French fiddlers
and singers arrived, and were officially entitled 'The Countess
of Urach's Musicians.'</p>

<p>It was all very absurd, without doubt; a mock court, but
gay, brilliant, lavish, and gradually various members of the
legitimate court filtered in to T&uuml;bingen and were swept into
the festive stream.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig was supremely happy. If at moments
he shrank a little from the Sittmanns, or Sch&uuml;tz plebeian airs
and insolences, still he was really entertained and amused.
Never a hint of dullness at Wilhelmine's court. The witticisms
were atrocious, the comedies lewd, the dancing a trifle
indecorous perhaps, but her real gaiety, her innate knowledge
of limits, and above all, her unfailing admiration
for her 'husband,' made life delightful at T&uuml;bingen. Towards
the beginning of September the 'court' moved to Urach, where
the Duke wished to enjoy some shooting and stag-hunting.</p>

<p>There was but one small cloud on Wilhelmine's sky at
this time, and this was the silence maintained by the
Emperor and his advisers. Eberhard Ludwig had informed
his Majesty of his marriage, craving his suzerain to ratify its
legality, and permit him to raise the Countess of Urach to
the rank of Duchess of Wirtemberg. He set forth that,
during ten years, his former wife Johanna Elizabetha had
been sterile, and therefore, as reigning Prince, he was at
liberty to declare that alliance null, and for the good of his
country take to wife another woman capable of bearing
children. He undertook to provide for Johanna Elizabetha
according to her royal position, and declared he would accord
her all honours due to an ex-Duchess of Wirtemberg, viz.
residence, monies, guards, privileges, titles, etc. The Duke's
epistle was an astounding document enough, especially coming
from a Prince whose repudiated wife had presented him with
an heir, albeit that heir, the Erbprinz Friedrich Ludwig, was
but a sickly specimen of mankind&mdash;a youth unlikely to live
long enough to succeed his father or to provide successors to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
his House. In this imperial silence lay the opportunity of
Zollern and the Catholic party, who believed that if the
Emperor proved obdurate, it would be possible to obtain
from Rome a decree of annulment of Johanna Elizabetha's
marriage, on the pretext of State necessity. Of course, the
price of this papal concession was Eberhard Ludwig's conversion
to the Roman faith, and the reinstalment of Catholicism
as the State religion of Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>Zollern fully realised that Wilhelmine was playing a
dangerous game; he knew that any day an imperial edict
might crush her, branding her as a bigamist. The brunt
would fall on <i>her</i>, for Eberhard Ludwig, as reigning Prince
and valuable ally of Imperial Vienna, would escape with a
reprimand. But for her an Austrian prison was on the cards,
or at best perpetual exile and outlawry, which would make it
difficult for any State to befriend her. He bethought him of
his kinsman, Frederick <span class="smcap">i.</span> of Prussia, an amiable monarch,
and Zollern's personal friend and cousin. If Austria proved
obdurate, and Rome objected to entering into a dispute with
Vienna, at least Wilhelmine could find powerful protection at
Berlin. Zollern wrote to his cousin of Prussia, praying him
to grant the Countess of Gr&auml;venitz, Countess of Urach, a
perpetual Schutzbrief, or Lettre de Sauvegarde&mdash;an official
document binding the King of Prussia to protect the lady and
her property, if she appealed for aid. Frederick <span class="smcap">i.</span> granted
this without ado.</p>

<p>Still the imperial answer tarried. It behoved Eberhard
Ludwig to announce his marriage formally to the officials at
Stuttgart. Wilhelmine enjoying the prospect of the scene
urged Serenissimus to summon his Geheimr&auml;the, or Privy
Councillors, to Urach immediately. They were to arrive at the
castle in the afternoon, she decided; the marriage was to be
announced, then a State banquet was to take place in the
ancient tilting-hall beneath the castle. This latter, of course,
she would not attend; but it would be followed by a grand
ball in the Golden Hall, where all should greet her as Queen
of the Revels, as legal wife of their Duke, as Countess of
Urach and future Duchess of Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>Thus it befell that on the 15th of September 1707, eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
pompous gentlemen, Geheimr&auml;the of the Dukedom, arrived
at the castle of Urach. They were met with much ceremony
at the gate and conducted to the Golden Hall. A delightful
quaint place this: picture to yourself a large apartment, three
sides of which open out in lattice windows through which,
if your eye wanders, you see the rounded Swabian hills
densely clad in beech and pine. On the summit of one of
the nearest of these hills stands the grim fortress of Hohen-Urach,
an impregnable stronghold of medi&aelig;val days turned
prison in the eighteenth century. The Golden Hall is
decorated, as its name portends, with gilded devices on the
wall, with stately golden pilasters and formal green-painted
trees, whose branches meander quaintly over one entire wall
of the room, that wall unbroken by the windows. Over the
two heavily carved doors the tree-branches twine and twist
into the word '<span class="smcap">attempto</span>,' the proud motto of Count
Eberhard 'the Bearded,' a great gentleman of the Cinque
cento, whose nuptials with a Princess of Mantua were celebrated
in the same Golden Hall. In memory whereof their
nuptial bed still stood in the hall where Eberhard Ludwig
assembled his Privy Council for the announcement of his
marriage with Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz, the Mecklemburg
adventuress. The councillors kept waiting in the Golden
Hall guessed the preposterous demand their Duke would
make to them. They were in a fine quandary. What to say
to a Prince who answered questions of legal right by: 'I am
above the law, alter the petty phrase in your code-book.' A
Prince, mark you, who could punish resistance with death.
And yet at Vienna was a suzerain who might chastise the
official participators in a crime against the Empire's laws.</p>

<p>So the eight councillors stood moodily waiting for their
Prince to appear, and contemplating with anger the elaborate
preparations for the evening's feast. Such flowers, such rich
hangings, and what were those two fine chairs?</p>

<p>The Duke was coming; they heard a woman's voice in the
corridor, a woman's laugh&mdash;most unseemly.</p>

<p>His Highness greeted them ceremoniously, and then:</p>

<p>'My honourable council, I have summoned you to announce
my marriage to the Reichsgr&auml;fin Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>
Countess of Urach, which was solemnised privately, though in
all legal and religious form, a year ago.'</p>

<p>No one has ever known why his Highness told this useless
untruth anent the date of his mock marriage, for he must
have known that none would believe that, at least; besides,
why tell an unnecessary lie?</p>

<p>'It is convenient to me to declare publicly my new
alliance at this time, and I desire that the news shall be
received by you and all my subjects in Wirtemberg, not only
without comment, but with fitting expressions of content and
with feasting and rejoicing. My late wife, the Princess
Johanna Elizabetha of Baden-Durlach, I direct shall receive
the honours and respect due to a Princess Dowager of
Wirtemberg, and I appoint you to arrange with her Highness
where she shall reside, provided it is not in or near my city of
Stuttgart. The appanage I concede to the Princess Dowager
Johanna Elizabetha is ten thousand gulden a year beside
her own small marriage dowry. To my present legal wife,
the Countess of Urach, I appoint royal honours and the castle
of Urach as residence, in addition to such lodgings as it may
please her to occupy in any other of my castles. She will
receive an appanage of twenty-five thousand gulden a year.
Gentlemen, you will take part in the festivities here to-day,
and to-morrow I charge you to repair to Stuttgart and to
acquaint the Duchess&mdash;&mdash;' he corrected himself hastily,
'Princess Johanna Elizabetha with these facts.'</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. The Geheimr&auml;the looked at
one another in consternation; this was an even more astounding
declaration than they had dreamed his Highness could
venture to make. Geheimrath von Hespen, a devoted
adherent of the Duchess Johanna Elizabetha, came forward.</p>

<p>'Your Highness, I speak in the name of my colleagues.
This thing you ask is impossible: law, religion, usage forbid.
I solemnly adjure your Highness to refrain from&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Herr von Hespen, I have given you my commands. It
remains for me to inform you of the penalty I impose upon
such as are disobedient to me. All who refuse to carry out
my instructions cease to be members of my Privy Council;
those who venture to speak against me or my wife are guilty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
of treason. As I think you are aware, the punishment of
treason is death.'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur the Prelate Osiander,' announced the page-in-waiting
as he flung open the door of the Golden Hall.
Eberhard Ludwig turned excitedly to greet the Prelate.</p>

<p>'Osiander,' he cried, 'you have come in time.'</p>

<p>'God grant I have, Serenissimus,' returned Osiander
sternly.</p>

<p>'As a priest of God I pray you to tell these gentlemen that
those whom God has joined together no man's power can put
asunder!' cried his Highness.</p>

<p>'That is exactly what I have the duty to remind your
Highness,' returned the Prelate. 'The Duchess Johanna
Elizabetha, your wife&mdash;&mdash;' Eberhard Ludwig started
violently; he saw that he had blundered.</p>

<p>'I do not speak of my <i>late</i> wife, Monsieur le Pr&eacute;lat.
She is no longer my wife! She who holds that position is
Wilhelmine, Countess of Urach.'</p>

<p>'Impossible, Serenissimus, as long as the Duchess Johanna
Elizabetha lives,' replied Osiander.</p>

<p>'By all the rites of the Church, by the law of God and man,
I am truly wedded to the Countess of Urach!' the Duke
answered passionately.</p>

<p>'As long as your Highness lives in mortal sin the Church
denies you the Sacraments. I am the representative of the
Church, your Highness, and in the presence of your Privy
Council I pronounce this ban upon you,' said the Churchman
severely.</p>

<p>'Let me remind you that there is another Church.
Remember I am Pope in my land! If you of the Lutheran
confession will not serve me, I will seek consolation in an
older faith!' cried Eberhard Ludwig.</p>

<p>The Geheimr&auml;the, huddled together in a whispering,
wavering, frightened group, had listened to Osiander's grave
words in silence, but at this speech of his Highness's they
broke into agitated exclamations:</p>

<p>'His Highness does not know what he says! Roman idolatry!
Ah! Monseigneur! It is contrary to the testament
of Eberhard the Ancient and the true laws of Wirtemberg!'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
Eberhard Ludwig paid no heed to these varied ejaculations of
his Privy Councillors. He was watching Osiander's stern face,
and his own expression was as unrelenting as the Prelate's.</p>

<p>'Is this your last word, Monsieur Osiander?' he said
quietly.</p>

<p>'Yes, Monseigneur, my last word, and the decision of the
Church which I represent.'</p>

<p>'Then, sir, I can dispense with your presence in my castle
of Urach,' replied the Duke haughtily.</p>

<p>The Prelate withdrew without a word. Eberhard Ludwig
waited till Osiander passed out of the Golden Hall, then:
'Gentlemen, you have heard. Now I require you to sign
this document. Those who do not sign, cease to be members
of my Privy Council.' He drew a large folded paper from his
breast, and laying it open upon the table desired one of the
Geheimr&auml;the to read it aloud. It was a repetition in formal
legal terms of his Highness's speech to the Council, and had
been drawn up and cleverly worded by Sch&uuml;tz, the fraudulent
attorney of Vienna.</p>

<p>'Your Highness takes the entire responsibility of this
act?' questioned one of the councillors.</p>

<p>'Yes, noble sirs, and I have but to add that such of you as
do not sign will be arrested immediately.' He moved back a
few paces, and pushing open the door revealed to the councillors
a detachment of Silver Guards stationed in the corridor without.
Seven Geheimr&auml;the approached the table and without more
ado affixed their signatures to the document. Only Herr von
Hespen remained.</p>

<p>'I await your decision, sir,' said Serenissimus harshly.</p>

<p>'I shall not sign,' replied Hespen.</p>

<p>'Arrest this gentleman!' called the Prince; 'and now, sirs,
we will repair to the tilting-hall and our banquet.'</p>

<p>The small town of Urach was in a state of such commotion
as it had not known since the far-off day when Count
Eberhard the Bearded received his Mantuan bride at the
castle. All day coaches rolled into the courtyard of the old
inn, and the narrow streets were filled with servants anxiously
seeking lodgings for their masters. At every moment coaches
drew up in the courtyard of the small hostelry and companies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
of fine gentlemen rode in. Every one demanded accommodation,
and quarrels and protestations filled the air. In the
streets hawkers called their wares, ribbons, laces, patches.
A strolling vender of reputed wonder-working balsams and
philtres attracted a laughing crowd; itinerant musicians
arrived on the scene and added the strains of stringed instruments
and the choruses of gay songs to the general clamour.
Urach, the quiet hill-town, where many quaint fountains
murmur ceaselessly, seemed turned into a place of carnival.
Near the castle gate the crowd of peasants and burghers was
dense, every one inquisitive to catch a glimpse of the gay doings
within, but the sentries kept the people back and only the
foremost watchers could see the interior of the courtyard.
Here too was festive bustle, for his Highness sat at the grand
banquet in the tilting-hall, and serving-men ran hurriedly
across the courtyard bearing steaming viands from the kitchen
or laden with platters of delicious cakes. The Duke's Cellar-master
appeared in the gateway and, addressing the expectant
mob, shouted the welcome statement that his Highness desired
his friends of Urach to drink to his health. Barrels of wine
were rolled across to the castle gate and the onlookers served
with copious draughts. Then the Cellar-master called for
silence, and, striking an attitude, he spoke:</p>

<p>'His Highness prays you to drink long life and happiness
to his noble bride, the Countess of Urach. Come&mdash;Hoch!
and again&mdash;Hoch!'</p>

<p>'Bride, indeed!' roared the crowd; 'harlot, you mean!'
some said, but they drank greedily all the same.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine was waiting in the Golden Hall, and through the
open casement she heard the comments of the rabble. 'Harlot,
adulteress, witch,' she repeated slowly, as she listened to these
epithets used by the men while they drank her health. She
raged. 'Ah, you canaille!' she whispered, 'it was <i>I</i> ordered
you that good red wine! Blood I will give you to drink
another time, blood to choke you.' She drew back from her
place near the window. 'But your hatred shall not mar my
triumph to-night. God's curse on you, my husband's people!'</p>

<p>The Golden Hall was decked in white flowers, and at one
end of the large room, twined and garlanded with roses, a da&iuml;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>
had been raised, and two huge gilt chairs, the only ones in the
apartment, had been placed on this platform. It looked like
a throne of King and Queen, and Eberhard Ludwig himself
had protested at this uncustomary assumption of a regal
superiority over his guests. But Wilhelmine had silenced
him with a look. She had pointed to Duke Eberhard's
motto.</p>

<p>'Attempto,' she whispered; 'Prussia is a kingdom now,
why not Wirtemberg?'</p>

<p>Now Prussia's advancement was an eyesore to South
Germany, and Eberhard Ludwig's envious ambition was
stirred.</p>

<p>'Attempto,' he murmured as he went to prepare to meet his
Geheimr&auml;the. The success of this s&eacute;ance we already know.</p>

<p>The moments dragged. From the window of the Golden
Hall Wilhelmine could see the church clock's slow finger
lagging from point to point. Below, the crowd was still
drinking and shouting, and the hated woman shuddered when
she thought what would be her fate were she at the mercy of
that throng which celebrated her wedding festivities.</p>

<p>Coaches rumbled into the courtyard. Soon the Countess
heard voices in the White Hall or music-room, where
the guests had been requested to assemble, pending the
reception in the Golden Hall by his Highness.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine hurried away to complete her preparations for
what she intended to be one of the hours of triumph in her
career.</p>

<p>She found Madame de Ruth and the maid Maria polishing
the jewels she was to wear.</p>

<p>'Quick!' she cried, 'the guests arrive!'</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear,' said Madame de Ruth dryly, 'all Stuttgart
is coming here, I am told. The virtuous indignation was not
strong enough. Curiosity has brought every one to see what
you do.'</p>

<p>'Give me <i>all</i> the jewels, Maria,' was Wilhelmine's only
reply.</p>

<hr />

<p>'Monseigneur le Duc de Wirtemberg et Madame la Comtesse
d'Urach!' called Oberhofmarshall Count Gr&auml;venitz, striking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
his marshal's staff heavily upon the wooden floor of the
corridor outside the Golden Hall. Then the doors flew open,
and the new Oberhofmarshall proceeded to the middle of the
hall where he repeated his staff-tapping and loud announcement.
The guests drew back. 'Really! is she to come in
procession like a queen?' 'Upon my soul, this is too much
to swallow!' 'Quelle insolence!' One could hear these
murmurs run through the assemblage; nevertheless the guests
fell back obediently, making room for the solemn entry of his
Highness.</p>

<p>'Is she beautiful, at least?' queried a gentleman who,
having but recently returned from the army, had not yet seen
the famous Gr&auml;venitzin.</p>

<p>'Pockmarked, and as tall as a grenadier,' said a spiteful
voice&mdash;a woman's.</p>

<p>'She sings divinely,' said another voice.</p>

<p>'Her notes are very strong, if you mean that! She nearly
breaks your ears,' replied the same voice.</p>

<p>Now the musicians struck up a stately measure, and two
pages, of the Sittmann family, of course, appeared in the doorway
walking backwards. Hofmarshall Gr&auml;venitz thundered
with his baton upon the ground; it must be conceded he
seemed to take fondly to the exercise of his new duties. And
now Eberhard Ludwig was seen in the doorway. His Highness
wore a magnificent costume of white brocade, relieved
only by the broad ribands of several high orders, and on his
breast the chain of Austria's Golden Fleece. Of a truth,
Serenissimus looked a fine Prince, but all eyes were upon
the tall figure beside him&mdash;the Mecklemburg Fr&auml;ulein, the
Countess of Urach. Her underskirt was made of cloth of
gold, rich and heavy; her huge paniers were of embroidered
satin of the Gr&auml;venitz yellow, as it came to be called in after
years; her corsage was yellow also, and from her shoulders
fell the white brocade cloak lined and trimmed with ermine,
which she had worn on the day of her secret marriage at the
Neuhaus. Her breast was literally ablaze with jewels, and
the pearls of Wirtemberg, which two hundred years before the
Mantuan princess had brought as marriage dowry, hung in
ropes round the favourite's neck. So splendid a vision had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>
never met the eyes of the assembled company. The Duchess
Johanna Elizabetha had worn these jewels, but they had somehow
seemed to disappear in the awkward masses of her ill-chosen
garments. You may imagine, however, that her
Highness had given the gems unwillingly to Eberhard
Ludwig's messenger charged to bring them forthwith to
Urach.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine advanced slowly, led by his Highness. She
bowed gravely to right and left. The guests were astounded,
struck dumb by the huge presumption of the woman; some
few returned her salute, others, bewildered and indignant,
stared her blankly in the face. Serenissimus led her to the
da&iuml;s, and as she took her seat bowed profoundly over her
hand. The pages gathered round the steps of the da&iuml;s.
Madame de Ruth took up her position beside this pseudo-Duchess's
chair. Oberhofmarshall Gr&auml;venitz stood to the
Duke's right, the Sittmann family ranged themselves in a
circle near this mock throne. Sch&uuml;tz, the fraudulent attorney,
mighty fine in brown satin and gaily embroidered waistcoat,
took a patronising and curious air as though, accustomed as
he was to the ceremony of Vienna's court, he found himself
much diverted by this provincial gathering.</p>

<p>Formal presentations began. The Countess of Urach had
a gracious smile for each and all, and the guests found themselves
in an unpleasant dilemma. It is so difficult to be disagreeable
to a smiling woman without actually insulting her;
and that would have been dangerous, for who could tell what
the future might bring forth?</p>

<p>Thus the ball progressed right merrily, and Wilhelmine's
triumph was complete. The formality of the entertainment
wore off a little, and the company danced gaily. Wilhelmine
did not dance after the first gavotte, whose stately measure
she trod with Monseigneur de Zollern, but this was a solemn
ceremony. For the rest, the Countess of Urach sat in her
gilded chair and conversed with chosen courtiers who were
led up to her by the Oberhofmarshall or by Madame de Ruth.
It was noticeable how the men lingered near her, and the
ladies' angry spite was increased thereby. His Highness
danced much and often. He was justly celebrated as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
finest, most graceful, most precise dancer of his day, and
Stafforth&mdash;who compiled a ponderous, pompous memoir of
Eberhard Ludwig's journey to England to the court of Queen
Anne, and also to the court of France&mdash;has left it on record
that 'they all stood surprised before my Prince's great agility
and marvellous skill.'</p>

<p>So pavane followed gavotte and sarabande and the more
modern minuet, and the ball was very brilliant and gay.</p>

<p>Late in the evening Sch&uuml;tz, his Highness's own secretary,
was called away.</p>

<p>'Affairs of State!' he said airily, but so loudly that many
should hear him. A sudden presentiment knocked at Wilhelmine's
heart: could this be some disastrous happening come
to mar her triumph? She signed to Madame de Ruth.</p>

<p>'A cruel foreboding is over me, dear friend,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Tut! child, what should it be? Come, forget it, enjoy
your hour.'</p>

<p>'Alas! the best hours are always pursued by evil things!'
replied Wilhelmine sadly. She turned to Reischach, who
stood near her. 'Come and tell me a story of some gallant
adventure, Baron! Now let us hear&mdash;you and a princess let
it be, for I love the stories to which I am accustomed!' She
smiled maliciously, but the laughter froze on her lips, for
Sch&uuml;tz was making his way towards her, and there was a look
on his face which told her the foreboding had not erred.</p>

<p>'News from Vienna, Madame,' he said in a low voice when
he reached her side.</p>

<p>'Tell me quickly what it is,' she whispered back.</p>

<p>'Imperial mandate to his Highness. I know no more; but
the messengers are of rank, and have the Emperor's commands
to read the decree to his Highness in person. I fear it is
very serious for you.'</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig came up gaily. 'Come, Madame ma
femme&mdash;come and tread a measure with me!' Wilhelmine
rose obediently.</p>

<p>'Have the messengers shut into the White Hall, make no
disturbance here,' she murmured as she passed Sch&uuml;tz.</p>

<p>With smiling face and merry jest she danced the sarabande.</p>

<p>'And now, Monseigneur!' she cried in a ringing voice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[<a href="./images/180.png">180</a>]</span>
when the dance concluded, 'let us end these revels, it grows
late! I pray you command the lackeys to bring the Tokay
that we may drink our loving-cup with our guests!'</p>

<p>The wine was brought and quickly given round.</p>

<p>'My gentle ladies and noble sirs!' called his Highness, <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins>I
drink to your happiness; I pray you drink to mine!'</p>

<p>The guests raised their glasses, and it was only as they
drank that they saw Eberhard Ludwig bowing before Wilhelmine,
and they realised with dismay that they had toasted
her under the title of 'his Highness's happiness.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE DUCHESS'S BLACK ROOMS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'In God's hands are all things. It is blasphemy to fear.'</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Imperial decree was uncompromising: 'She leaves your
court, this adventuress, or ill betide her. If you take a
mistress, well and good&mdash;that is not in the power of Emperor
to forbid; but you have infringed the Empire's laws by bigamy,
Serenissimus, and this we will not tolerate. The lady must
depart; if she goes not, the rigours of the law will crush her.
No more of your mock marriage, no more of your sorry, sham
court.'</p>

<p>Thus the gist of the document which shattered Wilhelmine's
hopes and interrupted her triumph at Urach. But to relinquish
her ambition thus easily, instantly to render obedience
to Father Vienna, this was not to be expected from so potent
a lady, nor indeed from Eberhard Ludwig, who, besides being
deeply enamoured, judged his prerogative as an independent
reigning Prince to be threatened by this summary command.
Then, too, all the parasites of the mock court advised resistance;
urged it in every way, for their own existence depended upon
the Countess of Urach and the continuance of her royal
retinue.</p>

<p>His Highness penned a private letter to the Emperor, in
which he set forth many arguments and added passionate
entreaties. In his reasoning he quoted historical examples
of a Prince's right to discard a wife for causes of State
necessity or convenience. Even Henry <span class="smcap">viii.</span> of England was
held up as a pattern in this! One wonders whether the
Emperor had sufficient historical learning to smile at this
unfortunate reference.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<a href="./images/182.png">182</a>]</span>
Sch&uuml;tz was despatched with this private missive and other
intricate legal documents.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the life at Urach went its usual course: hunts,
feasts, music, cards, love and laughter. Naturally those few
members of the former Wirtemberg court who had suffered
themselves to be drawn into the vortex of gaiety, now withdrew,
and the Gr&auml;venitz circle grew to be more and more the
refuge of the brilliant disreputable. Adventurers flocked in
from all sides and, were they but entertaining, immediately
became bright satellites revolving round the sun of Wilhelmine's
magnificence. Of course, these personages were not
welcomed by the older stars&mdash;the Sittmanns and company;
but the favourite waxed more overbearing, more autocratic
each day, and she permitted no censure of her will.</p>

<p>The Duchess Johanna Elizabetha was not idle; she had
summoned her family from Baden-Durlach, and they were
moving heaven and earth, or rather Vienna, in her cause.</p>

<p>Sch&uuml;tz wrote that things were going badly for the Gr&auml;venitz:
the Emperor was obdurate, the Privy Council was stern, and
public opinion strong against the double marriage.</p>

<p>Johanna Elizabetha at this crisis fell ill&mdash;'of a colic,' said
the court of Urach scornfully; 'of poison,' said Stuttgart,
Baden-Durlach, finally Vienna. This was serious, wrote
Sch&uuml;tz. There were not wanting persons who hinted that
other inconvenient wives had died of this same class of colic,
and that the illness had been caused by the rival mistress.
Eberhard Ludwig raged, Wilhelmine laughed, but Zollern
looked grave, and spoke of the Prussian letter of royal protection,
and of the beauty and safety of Schaffhausen.</p>

<p>Anger gave place to anxiety, when a private letter from
the Emperor to Eberhard Ludwig arrived. It was really an
unpleasant letter, and the court, to whom its contents were
communicated, felt that it was the beginning of the end. His
Majesty wrote that he gave Serenissimus one last chance of
saving the lady of his heart. She must yield at once, or the law
would proceed against her ruthlessly. The Emperor added
that he had commissioned the Electors of Brunswick, Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel,
and Hesse-Cassel to act as intermediaries in
the matter. They were empowered to settle the dispute in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[<a href="./images/183.png">183</a>]</span>
Majesty's name and in the interests of virtue, law, and order.
Serenissimus was overwhelmed. He vowed he would abjure
his allegiance to Austria, and as for the Protestant Church
which had proved so inconveniently honest, that could go by
the board and he would go over to Rome.</p>

<p>The Pope Clement <span class="smcap">xi.</span> was unfriendly to Austria politically,
and his Holiness would welcome the Duke of Wirtemberg to
the fold. For the rest, Eberhard Ludwig talked wildly of
approaching Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> and throwing in his lot and his army
with his old adversaries. The Pope was indeed informed of
the whole tangle, and had entered into secret negotiations
with Zollern on the subject.</p>

<p>Hereupon Forstner reappeared, and by his reproaches, his
tediousness, and his tactlessness nearly confirmed Serenissimus
in his frantic decision. Then arrived Osiander. He was a
man of great strength of character and intellect, and he
succeeded in demonstrating to the Duke the dishonourable
nature of his intentions. Also he induced his Highness to
comprehend that the Pope, though ready to gather all men,
and especially princes, into the maw of Rome, could not make
a double marriage legal where there was no feasible plea for
annulment of the first union. To be politically hostile to
Austria was one thing, to enter into open combat with her
another. Wirtemberg was not a large enough bribe in any
case.</p>

<p>At this juncture arrived the Electorial ambassadors, and
lengthy, tedious negotiations commenced. The deliberations
seemed endless. Did the ambassadors believe their task to
be nearing completion, the other side had always a fresh
plea, a new quibble; and the winter was far advanced
before these unfortunate envoys declared that they could do
no more.</p>

<p>'We have proved the so-called marriage to be illegal,'
they wrote to the Emperor; 'we have offered lands and moneys
to the favourite; we have been conciliatory, then threatening,
but Serenissimus is as one blinded, and the woman remains
in her preposterous position. We can do no more, save
humbly to recommend your Majesty to enforce the rigours
of the law against this bigamous female.' So Brunswick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, and Hesse-Cassel retired discomfited.</p>

<p>On the other side, Sch&uuml;tz in Vienna had made no headway.
The mock court continued as before, sometimes at Urach,
sometimes at T&uuml;bingen or Wildbad. Stuttgart was deserted,
save for the mournful presence of the unhappy Duchess.</p>

<p>The Countess of Urach's circle widened considerably,
constantly enlarged by inquisitive travellers, and it was
marvellous how many of these persons lingered and took
root in the easy, evil soil of this unhallowed, unlawful court.
The very servants were for the most part of doubtful character,
and it is remarkable how successfully the Gr&auml;venitz ruled her
strangely composed household. She had the power to win
hearts when she chose, and she did choose where her domestics
were concerned. Her method was based on the human point
of view. 'If I take this rascal into my service and treat him
well, he will respond by gratitude. At least, he will be bound
to me and to my interests. Should he betray me I can punish
him; but he is too disreputable for any one else to defend,
therefore he is mine, my creature.' These theories she expounded
to Madame de Ruth, never to Serenissimus. He,
poor deluded one, thought his mistress a very charitable
lady, and loved her the more for her kindness to sinners.
Among this motley crew of her choosing was an Italian of
the name of Ferrari, who had come to T&uuml;bingen with a troupe
of strolling actors.</p>

<p>In T&uuml;bingen the man had fallen ill, and Wilhelmine, hearing
through the maid Maria of the Italian's misery, caused him
to be nursed back to life. Then, when the grateful rascal
came to thank his benefactress, she took him into her service.
The man proved himself useful; he was quick and intelligent,
and conceived a dog-like affection for the Gr&auml;venitz, who
rewarded him by employing him in any secret message she
desired to be conveyed. He it was who procured for her the
various ingredients she used in her magic brewings. He who
spied upon the Duchess, for Wilhelmine had a morbid
curiosity to know each action of the woman she injured.
The people whispered that Ferrari instructed the Gr&auml;venitz
in the mysterious and terrible secrets of Italian poisons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
This gossip reached the ears of Johanna Elizabetha and she
trembled, fearing poison in all she ate, in all she touched, in
the petals of the roses of the castle garden, in the dust which
lay on the road.</p>

<p>An ugly story leaked out. The Duchess's head cook,
Glaser by name, recounted how Ferrari had visited him and
offered him a purse of gold and a little phial which contained
a greyish white powder. This, Ferrari had told him, was a
rare medicine known in Italy alone; it would cause a barren
woman to become fruitful. The Italian told Glaser that this
precious physic was sent for her Highness Johanna Elizabetha
by one who loved her well and would fain serve her.
Glaser was desired to sprinkle it on the Duchess's food, but
her Highness must be unaware of its presence, for such
knowledge would destroy the medicine's efficacy. Glaser
replied that he would willingly serve so noble and unfortunate
a lady as Johanna Elizabetha, but he refused to take the
responsibility of administering the powder. If, however,
Ferrari first showed it to the court doctor, Schubart, Glaser
would undertake to mix the stuff into some dish for her
Highness. At mention of the physician, Ferrari disappeared
and did not return. Then Glaser averred he had been set
upon near the Judengasse one dark night, soon after Ferrari's
visit. Two masked bravos attacked him from behind, and
it was only by the chance passing of the town guard that he
had escaped with his life. Her Highness heard this story
and she smiled bitterly, knowing that her barren state proceeded
from a very important omission, and that no powder
could be efficacious. And who should know this better than
the Gr&auml;venitz? the sender of this absurd powder, as the
Duchess surmised. 'Poison!' said the Duchess, and despatched
a broken-hearted letter to Vienna telling of her
bodily peril.</p>

<p>The days lengthened, bright April came with the calling
and rustling of Spring in all the air. There were mighty gay
doings again at Urach, but Stuttgart held aloof. Things had
gone too far; the story of the white powder had played the
Gr&auml;venitz an evil turn, and people were genuinely horrified at
her wickedness. Not a jot cared Wilhelmine. 'The Stutt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>garters
were such provincials, such shabby, heavy, rude
louts,' said the lady from G&uuml;strow. There were no festivities
at the castle in Stuttgart. How should there be with the
agonised, deserted woman as hostess?</p>

<p>It was her Highness's custom to pray and meditate in
solitude for an hour when the day waned. She led a busy, if
sedentary, life; sewing her eternal garments of coarse flannel
for the poor while Madame de Stafforth read aloud from books
of piety. A number of poor people came to the castle, and her
Highness was ever ready&mdash;nay, eager, to listen to their tales
of misery and to distribute alms to these her only courtiers.
Then there were the legal reports of the learned doctors-at-law
engaged upon her matrimonial business. Johanna
Elizabetha welcomed the twilight hour's solitary musing.
Poor soul! often she spent this hour on her knees, mourning
her sorrow before God.</p>

<p>One evening towards the middle of April, the Duchess had
withdrawn as usual to her own apartments leaving Madame
de Stafforth in the chief salon reading a sermon by an eminent
Swiss divine. The two ladies had felt strangely nervous and
anxious during the afternoon, and several times it had seemed
to her Highness that she heard stealthy footsteps on the
inner gallery of the courtyard, but when she questioned the
page-in-waiting whose duty it was to watch at the door of the
ante-hall leading to her Highness's rooms, the youth replied
that he had seen and heard nothing. The Duchess told herself
she was becoming a fearsome, anxious old woman, and she
endeavoured to smile down the haunting feeling of some
unseen, creeping presence. Still it was with a sense of
trepidation that she entered the small room where she was
wont to meditate each evening when the day's wearisome, self-imposed
labours were ended. This room lay beyond her
Highness's sleeping chamber and had a small balcony looking
over the Lustgarten.</p>

<p>This apartment was plainly furnished, almost monastic in
its simplicity: one chair, a small bureau, a table on which lay
a few books of sermons and volumes of theological treatises,
and a praying-stool stood against the wall. The only thing
recalling the vanities of the world was a mirror let into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>
panel above the praying-stool. Indeed, this mirror was a
relic of one of poor Johanna Elizabetha's few happy hours.
Eberhard Ludwig had ordered the whole room to be panelled
with mirrors, having seen some such conceit in a ch&acirc;teau in
France during his travels. He had thought to please her
Highness by this attention, but the dull, awkward woman had
forbidden the completion of the plan: it was a wrongful waste
of money, she averred, and a French vanity! So Eberhard
Ludwig had angrily commanded the workmen to desist, and,
wounded and offended, he had reflected on his wife's lack of
appreciation of the little elegancies of life. True, she had
seemed pleased by his thought of her, she had thanked him&mdash;but
she had declined his present!</p>

<p>The only alteration in the castle which Johanna Elizabetha
had ever been known to order had been done, to the surprise
of all, some time after the Duke's desertion of his wife and
son. The entire suite of apartments which her Highness
occupied had been redecorated. The panelling, which was
of time-mellowed oak, the Duchess had caused to be painted
black, the chairs and tables of her rooms were covered with
black brocade, and the window curtains were fashioned
of the same sombre material. It was a strange fancy, the
exaggeration of a brain strung up, taut and strained to a
quivering line on the border of insanity. Yet the Duchess
was not mad, only sad to desperation, utterly humiliated,
shuddering with despair and shame. Possibly the unhappy
woman, shut into the silence of her dumb personality, had
here sought to give expression to her voiceless agony.</p>

<p>The effect of these black walls, black furniture, black
hangings, was odiously funereal. Some one said that her
Highness should complete the picture of mourning by donning
the sinister trappings of the Swabian widow&mdash;the bound
brow, the nunlike hood, the swathing band with which South
German widows of medi&aelig;val times hid their lips from the
sight of all men, in token of their bereavement and enforced
chastity.</p>

<p>Her Highness looked anxiously round her sleeping apartment
as she passed through. To her overstrung nerves each
darker shadow held an evil menace. A breeze crept in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
through the open casement, and swayed the heavy black
curtains round her Highness's bed, and she started back, thinking
that some hostile hand had moved the folds. In vain
she told herself how baseless were her fears. She chid herself
for a craven, but her heart still fluttered fearfully, and her
lips were a-tremble when she reached the little room. She
sank down in her chair with a sigh of relief. Here in
this little room, she reasoned, there could be nothing to fear;
here were no shadowy corners where a lurking enemy might
hide.</p>

<p>'O God! O God!' she wailed suddenly aloud, 'am I
going mad that I should tremble at a gust of wind, that I
should suffer this insane consciousness of some haunting
presence near me when I know I am, in truth, alone and
safe?' She covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>'Your Highness,' came a voice, and the unhappy woman
started to her feet in renewed alarm&mdash;'Your Highness, have
I permission to depart now? Monsieur de Stafforth
wishes me to assist at a supper he gives this evening.
As your Highness knows, my husband is very harsh to
me since the Duke dismissed him, and indeed I dare not
be late.'</p>

<p>It was Madame de Stafforth who, having finished reading,
had come to take leave of the Duchess.</p>

<p>'Alas!' said her Highness sadly, 'I am not permitted to
bear my sorrow alone; my friends must suffer also.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Madame,' said the little moth-coloured woman tenderly,
'we would all suffer joyfully, could we ease your Highness;
but think, Madame! you, at least, have one great
happiness: to all women it is not given to bear a son, and the
Erbprinz grows stronger each day.'</p>

<p>Poor little Madame de Stafforth! The tragedy of her life
lay in her words. She was childless; and Stafforth reproached
her&mdash;nay, taunted her daily with this, for he desired an heir
to carry on his new nobility.</p>

<p>'Forgive me, dear friend; indeed I am blessed. And my
son grows stronger, you really think?'</p>

<p>Johanna Elizabeth's face lit with a mother's tenderness,
and the two ladies plunged into a detailed discourse on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
Erbprinz's health. At length Madame de Stafforth took her
leave.</p>

<p>'Shall I send any one to your Highness?' she asked as she
reached the door.</p>

<p>The Duchess's terrors had been allayed by the familiar discussion
of the Erbprinz's ailments, but a thrill of nameless
fear passed through her when she remembered she would be
alone again in her sombre apartment. But this was weakness!
What had she read in the Swiss sermon? 'In the hands of
God are all things. It is blasphemy to fear darkness, solitude,
or the evil machinations of men. All is in the Great Grasp,
and each happening is made and directed by God.' The
solemn words came back to her now.</p>

<p>'Dear Madame de Stafforth, I can ring when I wish for
any one. Good night, and God bless you!' she said, and laid
her hand upon the small silver hand-bell which was on the
bureau near her.</p>

<p>When the sound of Madame de Stafforth's footsteps ceased,
her Highness turned to the books on the table and sought
the volume of Swiss sermons; but it was not there; evidently
Madame de Stafforth had forgotten to bring it from the salon.
The Duchess decided to fetch it, but she lingered a moment,
for it was unaccountably disagreeable to her to pass through
the half-light of her sleeping apartment.</p>

<p>'In the hands of God are all things!' she murmured, and
with firm step she moved towards the sombre chamber. Once
more she thought she saw the bed-curtains sway; she fancied
she heard a movement behind her. 'It is blasphemy to fear,'
she said, but she felt her brow moisten with the sweat of
terror.</p>

<p>She found the book, and resolutely re-entered the sleeping-room.
She would not allow her eyes to wander to the bed-hangings,
nor to search the dusky corners of the chamber.
She passed on, and, gaining the little study, laid the book
open on the table, and, leaning her head on her hands, began
to read; but she could not fix her attention on the page before
her. She was tortured by faint stirrings, by scarcely perceptible
sounds, by an eerie feeling of some lurking presence
always behind her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>
At length she could bear it no longer. She closed the
book and rose, intending to ring the hand-bell and summon
her attendants, but the words of the sermon echoed in her
brain: 'It is blasphemy to fear,' and she felt ashamed of her
impulse. She turned, and, going to the praying-stool, kneeled
in prayer.</p>

<p>'Give me strength, O God! to resist this baseless terror,'
she prayed. 'In thy hands are all things!' Yet her anxiety
was unsoothed, and the dread of madness came to her, but
with it grew a brave defiance: she would not go mad, she
would not! She saw herself a prisoner in some castle, kept
alive and well treated, perhaps, but a piteous object, a thing
for all to point at&mdash;'the mad Duchess!' And the Gr&auml;venitz
at Stuttgart a legal Duchess. She believed a Prince could put
away an insane wife. 'Not madness, kind Jesus!' she prayed.
Her heart was wrung in agony as she pictured her son, the
Erbprinz, taunted perhaps by the mention of his mother's
madness. 'All is in the Great Grasp, and each happening
is made and directed by God.' 'O Christ,' she prayed, 'I
believe, I trust, I will not blaspheme by fear; no madness can
strike me down while I believe and pray.' She lifted her hot
face from her hands, calmed, soothed, brave once more. She
was rising from her knees, and the movement brought her
eyes on a level with the mirror panel. As one turned to
stone, she stood looking into the mirror, for it reflected one
corner of her bed in the next room, and the fading light fell
on something white which pushed aside the black brocade
bed-curtain&mdash;a large yellow-white hand holding a small
gleaming knife. The Duchess, still with the dread of insanity
upon her, told herself that it was an hallucination, a delusion,
the frenzied working of her overwrought brain. She gathered
her courage and fixed her eyes on the mirror, which showed
her what she conceived to be a phantom. The hand was large,
with hair growing hideously over it, and jagged, bitten nails&mdash;she
could see this distinctly, for the light fell from the window
full on the black curtain, and showed up the yellow hand.
Fascinated, she gazed into the mirror, wondering the while
why, now that the horror actually confronted her, she felt so
little fear, whereas before she had started and trembled at each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
gust of wind. Now the hand emerged further from out the
hangings. An arm in a brown sleeve appeared. Then the
curtains parted, and her Highness saw a ferret-like face appear.
She knew that this was no phantom. Swiftly she calculated
the distance between her and the hand-bell. She remembered
that only her tiring-maid would come in answer to the usual
daily summons. If this man was indeed an assassin, he would
do his work immediately; kill her ere the woman could come,
and the unsuspecting maid herself might easily be silenced
with one stab from that pointed dagger. All this the Duchess
realised in a flash. She had never thought so rapidly in her
life. No! she must not ring; she must dupe the murderer!
Her eyes met the assassin's in the mirror, but she had the
strength to return the gaze in an abstracted fashion, so that
the man should be uncertain whether she had seen him, or
whether the mirror had failed, by some strange chance, to transmit
his reflection. Instinctively she felt that her death-warrant
would be signed did the man know her to be aware of his
presence. She moved towards the table; thus she was out of
the mirror's range, and she therefore could not see what the man
was doing in the adjoining apartment. 'Dupe him! escape by
ruse! get out of the rooms to the ante-hall, let him think I am
coming back!' Dully this thought struggled in her mind.
With extraordinary calmness she commenced to move the
books on the table, purposely rustling the pages. Then
suddenly she knew her only way of escape.</p>

<p>'Curious!' she said aloud; 'I thought my other book was
here. I have left it next door. I must find it and return to
read and rest.' As she said the words she walked into the
sleeping-room. 'God give me strength not to look towards
the bed,' she prayed silently. 'Lord, in thy hands are all
things. It is blasphemy to fear.'</p>

<p>Now she was in the shadowy bedroom; she moved slowly
across, saying again aloud: 'I will fetch the volume and
return.' As the words left her lips she realised she had
spoken in French; her ruse was useless then! The murderer
was probably some illiterate scoundrel; how should he comprehend?
But her dogged, methodical nature stood her in
good stead. If Johanna Elizabetha began anything, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>
invariably completed her task; so although she imagined her
strategy spoiled through her use of the French language, she
kept steadily moving across the large dark room. As she
gained the door leading to the audience-chamber she heard
the man's bitten, jagged nails scrape the silk brocade of the
hangings. He had pushed aside the curtains, then&mdash;he was
following her! 'God give me strength,' she prayed again.
With unhurried step she passed across the whole length of
the long audience-chamber, and gently opened the door of the
ante-hall. The page-in-waiting, a slight child of fourteen
years, sprang to his feet, bowing deeply, as her Highness
entered.</p>

<p>'Are you alone?' said the Duchess quietly. 'Is no lackey
in waiting?'</p>

<p>'No, your Highness; I have had the honour to guard your
Highness alone for the last few minutes. There is no one
else at all,' the boy replied, proud of the trust reposed in
him.</p>

<p>'I cannot give up this child to the assassin's dagger,'
thought the Duchess.</p>

<p>To her strained hearing there seemed to be a creeping movement
behind her. Quickly she pulled the key from the lock
on the inner door of the audience-chamber, and with trembling
hand fitted it into the keyhole on the ante-hall side.</p>

<p>'Quick, boy! fasten the other door leading to my apartment!'
she whispered.</p>

<p>The youth ran forward to do her bidding, and as she heard
the bolt fall under his hand she succeeded in turning the key
in the lock noiselessly.</p>

<p>'Call the guard! Quick! quick!'</p>

<p>Instantly the page rushed off, and once more Johanna
Elizabetha was alone with the owner of that yellow, hairy
hand, but with a bolted door between her and death this time.
Still she held the door-handle firmly, and she felt it being
gently tried from inside. Then she heard distinctly stealthy
footsteps stealing away across the audience-chamber.</p>

<p>The guard clattered into the ante-hall&mdash;fifty men in yellow
and silver uniforms, with drawn swords, and pistols showing
grimly at their sides. The captain of the guard inquired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>
her Highness's pleasure. The page had summoned him,
saying her Highness was in danger of her life.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Johanna Elizabetha shortly, 'assassination.
Search my apartments, the doors are locked.'</p>

<p>The men poured in: some straight through the audience-chamber,
others through the narrow corridor leading round
at the back of the Duchess's sleeping apartment. In a short
time the captain returned.</p>

<p>'We have found no one, your Highness; yet I have left
my men to search again, though in truth we have inspected
every inch of all the rooms.'</p>

<p>He looked at Johanna Elizabetha curiously as he spoke.
Did he guess her mad? She felt guilty, suspected. Could
that horrid vision, that creeping, lurking man, have been a
phantom? A thing, then, of her own creation, not a ghost of
the castle&mdash;no, a spectre of her own!</p>

<p>'You cannot have searched everywhere,' she said. 'There
are no ghosts in the castle save the White Lady, and I saw a
man skulking in my apartments.'</p>

<p>'Your Highness, the search has&mdash;&mdash;,' he began.</p>

<p>'I will direct your men, Monsieur,' she interrupted
hurriedly, and entered the audience-chamber. Carefully the
soldiers went through the rooms again, probing each dark
corner and under the hangings with their swords, but no one
was to be found. The sweat stood on her Highness's brow.
She knew she would give all she possessed for the man to be
discovered. If he were not, she knew that she must become
insane&mdash;nay, she would be proved already mad to her own
knowledge.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shout went up from the soldiers who had penetrated
to her Highness's praying-room, which, owing to its
bareness and small size, had received at first but a cursory
glance from the searchers.</p>

<p>Against the balustrade in the angle of the small balcony
the murderer crouched. The soldiers dragged him forward
and flung him, an unresisting, trembling heap, on to the
middle of the floor. Her Highness hearing the commotion
hurried forward.</p>

<p>'You have found him, then? Oh, thank God!' she cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
'Pardon, pardon, by your mother's heart, I implore!'
moaned the miserable wretch, dragging himself like a crawling,
wriggling animal towards the Duchess. He was immediately
hauled back by the soldiers.</p>

<p>'Stand up, you worm, and give account of yourself,'
said the captain sternly, bestowing a kick on the man's
ribs.</p>

<p>'I meant no harm! By Christ! I meant no harm!' the
prisoner wailed.</p>

<p>'How came you in her Highness's apartments? Speak!'</p>

<p>'I am a stranger in Stuttgart,' replied the man.</p>

<p>'Here's a lie for you,' broke in a trooper; 'he's the
Gr&auml;venitz's private servant. I have often seen him at
T&uuml;bingen.'</p>

<p>'Yes! yes! yes! I am the Comtesse d'Urach's secretary;
but I return to Italy soon, and I wished to see the Duchess's
famous black rooms before I left! Curiosity has been my
undoing! Pardon! pardon!'</p>

<p>'If you only wanted to see my rooms,' said her Highness
gently, 'why did you hide from me beneath the hangings?
Why had you a poignard in your hand?'</p>

<p>'I had no poignard! By the Mother of God! I had no
poignard,' he whined.</p>

<p>'It is in his girdle, your Highness,' said the trooper, drawing
forth the dagger from the man's belt.</p>

<p>'I had a poignard in my girdle, but I meant no harm! I
meant no harm! Madame, you cannot think I would have
hurt you? Oh, mercy! mercy!' Once more he threw himself
at the Duchess's feet. 'I hid indeed. O Madame! I
feared your displeasure. Have mercy on me! I only wished
to see your beautiful black rooms before I went back to Italy.
When your Highness spoke of fetching the book&mdash;&mdash;' The
Duchess started. Of course the man was an Italian, and he
understood French; that was how her plan had not miscarried,
as she feared it had, when she thought her adversary was
some local cut-throat&mdash;'when your Highness spoke, I thought
I might escape while your Highness was away, and then the
doors were bolted and the guard came. Oh, mercy!'</p>

<p>'Poor soul, let him go,' said Johanna Elizabetha gently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>
'Your Highness, he shall go&mdash;to prison, till he is hanged.
My man here tells me he is the person who gave poison to
Kitchenmaster Glaser to sprinkle in your Highness's food,' the
captain answered.</p>

<p>'Alas! how evil are men's hearts,' sighed the Duchess.
'Take him, then, but treat him gently. He says he meant
no harm.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE SECOND MARRIAGE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> news of the discovery of Ferrari in her Highness's
apartments spread through Stuttgart during the evening, and
there arose a wave of intense indignation. The Gr&auml;venitz
was loudly denounced as the instigator of the attempted
crime, and a mob gathered before the J&auml;gerhaus, clamouring
in their fierce, blind rage to destroy the house where the
hated woman had resided. The riot grew so serious that it
was necessary to call out the town guard, and though the
knot of violent rioters was easily dispersed by the soldiers,
still during the whole night Stuttgart continued in an uproar,
and fears of a dangerous disturbance were entertained.</p>

<p>Messengers sped away to Urach, carrying the news of
Ferrari's attempt and exaggerated reports of the unquiet
state of the town.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning Forstner, who resided for
the most part at Stuttgart, finding the Gr&auml;venitz court little
to his liking, arrived at Urach, and pleading urgent private
business was immediately admitted to his Highness's audience-chamber.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine from her powdering-closet could hear Forstner's
deep voice, but, though she much desired it, she could not
distinguish the words. Once she caught the name 'Ferrari,'
and then again 'her Highness.' Could it be the old story of
Glaser and the white powder? she wondered. Impatiently
she tapped her foot on the ground. She called Maria and
inquired if Ferrari was in the castle. She was told he had
left Urach early on the preceding morning and had not been
seen since. Wilhelmine grew anxious at this. It struck her
disagreeably that the absent Italian should be the subject of
Forstner's early visit. Ferrari had been strangely gloomy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
preoccupied of late, she had remarked. Indeed, he had brooded
in this fashion ever since the Glaser affair. True, Wilhelmine
had taunted him cruelly with his failure, and the man always
took her lightest word to heart. He had conceived an
affection for her which was a trifle inconvenient&mdash;a jealous,
fierce affection made grotesque by his ugly, undersized
person.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig entered the powdering closet. His face
was deadly pale, and his eyes held a look of horror and
disgust which warned Wilhelmine of some grave occurrence.</p>

<p>'I have news of serious import, Madame,' he said coldly;
'kindly dismiss your serving-woman. I wish to speak to you
in private.'</p>

<p>Maria left the room with a sniff; she was accustomed to
better treatment. In fact, she bade fair to become a tyrant to
her lenient mistress.</p>

<p>'Mon Prince!' cried Wilhelmine as the woman disappeared,
'whatever the news, you seem to show me an ugly frown. I,
at least, cannot have displeased my beloved master, for I have
not left his side, and our commune together cannot have given
him offence.' She spoke lightly, but she watched his
Highness's stern face anxiously. It softened at her words.</p>

<p>'Ah, Wilhelmine, beloved, a terrible thing has happened!
And you are gravely accused.' Then he poured forth the
whole story of Ferrari's attempt. Wilhelmine listened in
silence; she knew that his accusation was extremely serious,
and the facts most difficult to explain away. To her consternation
she saw that his Highness himself half suspected
her of having a hand in the matter.</p>

<p>'Every criminal is allowed to answer his accuser,' she
said, when Eberhard Ludwig finished his narration. He
started forward.</p>

<p>'Accuser! Wilhelmine, am I your accuser? Do you think
I doubt you? but, O God! the facts are black against you.'</p>

<p>'Your words do not accuse me, Eberhard,' she answered;
'but your eyes and the stern soul behind them accuse me.
Nay, listen; how often have you praised me, calling me a
woman of much intelligence? Now, I ask you, consider for
a moment how a woman, gifted with even a spark of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
same intelligence, could act so foolishly as to have her
declared enemy, the obstacle to her happiness, removed by the
poignard of a servant well known to be in her employ? That
is one plea I would put forward, Monseigneur. Then again,
should I select the moment to contrive her Highness's death
when the world is ringing with that preposterous Glaser
story? I am branded as a bigamist,' she added bitterly; 'do
you fancy I wish to add the title murderess to my name?'</p>

<p>'But explain the circumstance of your servant being discovered,
poignard in hand, lurking in the Princess Johanna
Elizabetha's rooms. And oh! Wilhelmine, forgive me; but
this preposterous Glaser story, as you call it, has never been
properly explained. You have laughed, and I have put the
matter out of my thoughts; but now&mdash;O beloved! it is so
terrible to doubt you, but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine was unprepared for this retrospective attack.
She hesitated, and his Highness's face grew dark.</p>

<p>'I really must ask you to explain,' he said harshly, moving
away from her.</p>

<p>'Eberhard,' she said brokenly, 'I sent the powder to the
Duchess.'</p>

<p>Serenissimus started forward. 'You confess? O my
God!' he cried.</p>

<p>'Yes; I will tell you. The powder was a harmless
philtre. I brewed a magic draught which causes whoever
drinks it to forget the being they love, and become enamoured
of the first person they see. O Eberhard, believe me!'</p>

<p>'Fairy tales!' he almost laughed. 'But why given in
secret? why given at all?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'If she forgot you, forgot your charm, beloved, she would
be happy again. I had pity on her!'</p>

<p>It was poison she had sent, and even to herself her story
seemed too extravagant for credence. To her surprise, however,
his Highness believed her in this.</p>

<p>'Well, and for the rest? for Ferrari's being hidden in the
castle?' he questioned.</p>

<p>'Call Maria and ask her if I was aware that the madman had
left Urach. She can vouch that I thought him to be here.'</p>

<p>'Why did he do this thing?' said the Duke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>
'What explanation did he offer?' she queried hurriedly.</p>

<p>'That he wished to see the black rooms!' he replied.</p>

<p>'Well, but surely that is explanation enough? You know
the man's extraordinary love of beauty, his curious seeking
for unusual furniture. He is mad, Eberhard; I tell you he is
mad! We must save him from prison and send him back to
Italy.' She spoke so naturally, so easily, that his Highness
felt that sense of the unaccustomed, the unknown evil, the
grim suspicion of crime fall away, and an immense relief take
its place.</p>

<p>'Of course, of course!' he said hurriedly; 'I was frightened
by that fool Forstner. Forgive me for my insane suspicion.'
And he hastened away to assure Forstner of the sheer
absurdity of this accusation.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would have been a trifle shaken in his confidence
had he seen Wilhelmine fall back in her chair,
breathing hard like some wild animal who had escaped the
hunter's knife by a hair's-breadth.</p>

<hr />

<p>If Serenissimus was thus easily appeased, the authorities
and citizens of Stuttgart were not to be put off with a mere
tale. Also Johanna Elizabetha's friends and partisans were
loud in their accusations of the Gr&auml;venitz. Ferrari had been
released from prison by the Duke's command. The man was
mad, his Highness averred, and it was but merciful to send
him back to Italy. It leaked out that the Italian had left
Wirtemberg, but it was whispered that he carried a large sum
of gold with him.</p>

<p>'Blood money,' said the Stuttgarters, and their indignation
grew apace. Sch&uuml;tz wrote from Vienna that things were
going badly for the Gr&auml;venitz. The Emperor had been informed
of the Ferrari affair, and was reported to have
expressed his opinion in no measured terms. In fact, Sch&uuml;tz
strongly advised the Countess of Urach to leave Wirtemberg
for a time, but the lady remained firm. 'Go, I will not,
until I am obliged, and that is not yet,' she declared.</p>

<p>So the days passed as usual at Urach, outwardly. The
Duke shot roebuck daily in the early morning, the Countess
often accompanying him. Later, Serenissimus would ride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
young and fiery horses; but in this the Countess did not take
part, she was but a poor horsewoman. Then came a delicious
banquet, with the Countess of Urach's musicians in attendance
discoursing fair melodies.</p>

<p>During the afternoon his Highness drove eight, ten, and
sometimes twelve horses together, thundering through the
country, and the peasants soon learnt to associate their heretofore
beloved ruler with clouds of dust and ruthless speed.
A demon driver rushing past, who, they said, would crush
them were they not quick to fly to safety in their houses or
fields.</p>

<p>A demon driver with a beautiful, haughty-faced woman
beside him. Verily an appalling picture to the sleepy
Swabian peasant accustomed to the heavy swaying motion of
quiet oxen or laborious cart-horses.</p>

<p>Each evening at the castle of Urach there were merry doings:
dancing, cards, and music. It all seemed gay and secure
enough, but there was unrest beneath this outward peace, an
anxious feeling in the revellers' hearts. Madame de Ruth
chattered wittily; Zollern, gallant and wise, made subtle
ironic speeches; Wilhelmine sang, Serenissimus adored, the
Sittmanns and the parasites were chorus to this&mdash;a chorus a
little out of tune at times, perchance, but passable.</p>

<p>At length the imperial ultimatum arrived, and, like a card
house blown by a strong man's breath, the sham court fell, and
the Queen of Hearts knew that the game was played out.</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine, Countess Gr&auml;venitz, masquerading under the
title of Countess of Urach, is hereby declared an exile from all
countries under our suzerainty, nor can she hold property in
these aforementioned countries, nor call for the law's protection.
From the date of this writing she is given six days
wherein to leave Wirtemberg. After the expiration of this
term she must, an she remaineth in the land, stand her trial
for bigamy, treason, and implication in attempted murder.'&mdash;Signed
and sealed by the Emperor this.</p>

<p>There was no possible gainsaying; already the time allotted
to her for flight was exceeded, and at any moment she might
be arrested by the imperial order.</p>

<p>She fled to Schaffhausen once more, and in Stuttgart there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
was great rejoicing; but the joy was dashed to the ground
when the news came that Serenissimus had also disappeared.
Had he fled with his evil mistress, then? It was positively
averred, however, that she had gone alone with Madame de
Ruth. Witchcraft, of course! The Gr&auml;venitzin had bewitched
herself once before when she had disappeared for three days
from the old castle. His Highness himself had said openly that
she had returned to him in a flash of lightning. What more
likely than that she should have spirited Serenissimus away
with her to Switzerland?</p>

<p>'Nonsense,' said the Duchess-mother at Stetten; 'Eberhard
is roaming in the woods, crying to the trees that he is a
broken-hearted martyr!' And she hurried to Urach, taking
up her abode in the very apartments which Wilhelmine had
just vacated. It is on record that her maternal Highness
caused the rooms to be swept and garnished, ere she entered,
as though they were infected with the pest. 'So they are,'
quoth this plain-speaking dame, 'with the pest of vice!'</p>

<p>It is to be supposed that the Duchess-mother was right in
her surmise regarding her son's forest wanderings, for a
messenger arrived from Urach saying Serenissimus would re-enter
Stuttgart with his mother in a few days' time; which he
did, and was solemnly and publicly reconciled to the Duchess
Johanna Elizabetha. The grateful burghers voted their Duke
a free present of forty thousand gulden on his return, and to
his Duchess ten thousand gulden.</p>

<p>The Duchess-mother is reported to have remarked that, of
a truth, it had been fitting had they paid her back a portion
of the war indemnity. 'But it does not matter,' she said, 'so
long as that absurd boy, my son Eberhard, remains at his
duties in future.' Dear, proud, sensible old lady! God rest
her well! To her mother's heart, the thirty-seven-year-old
Duke of Wirtemberg, hero, traveller, incidentally bigamist,
remained eternally 'that absurd boy, my son.'</p>

<hr />

<p>It was with mingled feelings that Wilhelmine at Schaffhausen
heard of Eberhard Ludwig's reconciliation with his
wife. Anger and scorn of the man's weakness predominated,
but despair and humiliation tortured her as well, and a pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>found
discouragement, which the sound of the rushing, foaming
Rhine falls had no power to sooth this time. The enforced
inaction was terrible to her. It was her strategy to leave his
Highness's passionate letters of excuse and explanation unanswered,
and thus she had little wherewith to fill the long
summer days. Madame de Ruth was a delightful companion,
but Wilhelmine was unresponsive and seemed absorbed in
some intricate calculation. She would sit for hours, brooding
sombrely. Her eyes, narrowed and serpent-like, gazed at the
rushing waters, but when Madame de Ruth remarked on the
beauty of the scene she would answer irritably that she was
occupied, and only begged for quiet in which to think. Towards
the middle of August Sch&uuml;tz arrived from Vienna. He brought
with him a document which he prayed Wilhelmine to consider,
and to sign if she approved. It was entitled 'Revers de Wilhelmine,
Comtesse Gr&auml;venitz,' and set forth that she undertook
to relinquish all claims upon the Duke of Wirtemberg and
his heirs forever. That she recognised any child, born of her
relationship to his Highness, to be a bastard, and that she
undertook never to return to the court of Wirtemberg. If she
bound herself to these conditions, the Emperor, in return,
promised to cancel her exile from his fiefs with the sole exception
of Wirtemberg. The right to hold property would be
given back to her, and she would be released from suspicion
of murderous intent. His Majesty even promised her twenty
thousand gulden as compensation for any wrong done to her
in Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine hesitated, pondered, and finally despatched
Sch&uuml;tz to Stuttgart with a copy of the imperial document.
He laid it before the Privy Council, and stated that his
client, the Countess Gr&auml;venitz, was prepared to accept these
proposals, on the condition that Wirtemberg paid her a further
sum in compensation for her loss of honour, property, and
prospects.</p>

<p>The Privy Council fell into the trap. Anything to be
finally rid of the dangerous woman, done with the whole
noisome story. They had the example of M&ouml;mpelgard before
them, and they feared for Wirtemberg to be involved in a
similar tangle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>
Now M&ouml;mpelgard, or Montb&eacute;liard, as the French-speaking
court named it, was a small principality ruled by Eberhard
Ludwig's cousin, Duke Leopold Eberhard of Wirtemberg, a
liegeman of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> of France, and a man of strange
notions. He had been reared in the religion of Mahomet, and
with the faith he held the customs of Islam. Thus he had
married three women at once, legally, as he averred; and in
any case, the three wives lived in splendour at M&ouml;mpelgard's
castle. These ladies had had issue, and the succession to the
M&ouml;mpelgard honours was complicated.</p>

<p>Naturally Stuttgart's Geheimr&auml;the, with this cousinly
example in their minds, longed for the Gr&auml;venitz to renounce
all future claims upon the Dukedom of Wirtemberg, both for
herself and for any issue of her 'marriage' with Eberhard
Ludwig.</p>

<p>Thus when Sch&uuml;tz conveyed her demand for money as a
condition to her renouncement, they listened to the preposterous
request, and declared themselves ready to pay the
favourite compensation. Sch&uuml;tz returned to Schaffhausen
with this news, and was immediately re-despatched to
Stuttgart with a demand for two hundred thousand gulden
as the price of her renouncement.</p>

<p>The Geheimr&auml;the were aghast. Twenty thousand, nay,
even forty thousand, gulden they would pay, but two hundred
thousand! This vast sum to be wrung out of the war-impoverished
land! Impossible! Besides, it was as much
as the marriage-portion of six princesses of Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>The Duke was approached. He retorted that the Countess
of Gr&auml;venitz was perfectly justified in any demand she chose
to make. The Duchess-mother arrived, and spoke, as usual,
plainly to her son; but he had not forgotten how his mother
had dragged him, like a repentant school-child, from Urach to
be reconciled to Johanna Elizabetha. He owed the Duchess-mother
a grudge, and paid it by remaining firm concerning the
justice of Wilhelmine's claim.</p>

<p>The Privy Council offered her twenty thousand gulden.
Then forty thousand. Both sums were refused. 'Two
hundred thousand or nothing,' she answered. So the
negotiations were broken off.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
Meanwhile, had the Geheimr&auml;the but known it, the
'Revers' had long been signed, sealed, and despatched to
Vienna.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine again sent Sch&uuml;tz to Stuttgart with the
message that, as she had not been given just and fair compensation,
she would know how, at a future date, to wring out
from Wirtemberg a hundred times the modest sum refused
her.</p>

<p>The Geheimr&auml;the, thinking their foe vanquished and the
affair at an end, laughed at this threat. They would have
trembled had they known that the Gr&auml;venitz had a plan, and
that their Duke was cognisant of the whole matter.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wilhelmine, gazing at the waters of the Rhine with her
half-closed, serpent-like eyes, sought for some device which
should enable her to return to Stuttgart. In the first place,
she loved power; in the second, she loved Eberhard Ludwig;
in the third, she yearned to outwit her enemy Johanna
Elizabetha and her opposers generally. Then she longed once
more to defy the Duchess-mother, whom she, at the same
time, greatly dreaded.</p>

<p>By this you will see that Wilhelmine was no longer merely
the gay, charming, if scheming woman who had come to
Wirtemberg sixteen months before. She had developed.
Her extraordinary prosperity had poisoned her being. She
had grown hard. Could she not achieve the height of power
by one road, very well, she was ready to climb back by any
circuitous path she could find. For many days her ingenuity
and her searchings failed to show her any way back to
Stuttgart. It was the pretext for returning which she sought;
once there she knew she could grasp power again, and this
time she intended to retain it. A chance speech of Madame
de Ruth's set her on the track.</p>

<p>'Ah! my dear, we have gone too far; it is perilous to stand
on the top of the hill; better to remain near the summit,
indeed, but on some sheltered ledge whence we cannot be
toppled over. Had I had my way, you should have married
some high court dignitary, and as his wife you could have
ruled undisturbed.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>
'Can the wife of a court dignitary not be forbidden the
court?' said Wilhelmine idly.</p>

<p>'Naturally, my dear! The Emperor cannot order an
official of a German state to remove his wife from the court
where he is employed.'</p>

<p>'Only the prince's wedded wife can be exiled, then?' said
Wilhelmine sneeringly.</p>

<p>'My dear! we climbed too high, alas!' Madame de Ruth
replied.</p>

<p>Her words had started Wilhelmine on a new track of
thought. Married to a courtier holding high office at court,
she could return and resume her career. But that would
declare her marriage with Eberhard Ludwig to be a farce, she
reflected. Still, if this were the only way? In her mental
vision she reviewed each courtier, but she could find none
fitting for the position of husband in name. Sch&uuml;tz perhaps?
She laughed at the very idea. No; the bridegroom must be a
man of much breeding and no morals.</p>

<p>She wrote to Sch&uuml;tz requesting him to journey to Schaffhausen
on important business. The attorney arrived, and
Wilhelmine observed how shabby was his coat, how rusty his
general appearance. He was again the pettifogging lawyer
in poor circumstances, and Wilhelmine reflected that he would
be all the more anxious to serve her in order to return to his
ill-gotten splendour at her illegitimate court.</p>

<p>Sch&uuml;tz responded eagerly to her proposal. He acclaimed
her a marvel of intelligence, and assured her that in Vienna
he would be able to find the very article&mdash;a ruined nobleman
ready to sell his name to any bidder.</p>

<p>On the day following Sch&uuml;tz's advent at Schaffhausen,
Wilhelmine was surprised by a visit from her brother
Friedrich, who arrived in a deeply injured mood. Since
Wilhelmine left Urach, he averred, he had been treated in a
manner all unfitting for an Oberhofmarshall, and the head of
the noble family of Gr&auml;venitz. Serenissimus had paid him
scant attention, and Stafforth had been reinstated as Hofmarshall
to the Duchess Johanna Elizabetha&mdash;a brand new
dignity, complained this Oberhofmarshall of a sham court.
He made himself mighty disagreeable to his sister, varying his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
behaviour by outbursts of despair and noisy self-pity, which
would have been laughable had they not been so loud, violent,
and disturbing. Wilhelmine informed him of her plan, and
after many expressions of disapproval, when she had made it
clear to him that it would be entirely to his advantage if she
succeeded in her design, he gave the ugly plan his brotherly
blessing and his sanction as head of the family.</p>

<p>Hereupon Sch&uuml;tz returned to Vienna to seek a bridegroom.
In an astonishingly short time, he wrote that he had found
an admirably adapted person in the Count Joseph Maria
Aloysius Nepomuk von W&uuml;rben, a gentleman of very old
lineage, and ex-owner of a dozen castles in Bohemia, all of
which, however, had gradually been converted into gulden, and
the gold pieces, in their turn, had vanished into the recollection
of many lost card games. This personage, owing to his
sad misfortunes, found himself at the age of sixty inhabiting a
garret in Vienna.</p>

<p>Sch&uuml;tz wrote that he knew Monsieur le Comte well. They
met constantly at the eating-house. He further assured her that
W&uuml;rben was a very pleasant companion. Wilhelmine replied
that it was profoundly indifferent to her whether her future
husband was an agreeable companion or not, as she intended
only to see him once&mdash;viz., at her own marriage, after which
ceremony he could follow his namesake St. Nepomuk into the
waves of the Moldau, for aught she cared! It angered her
that Sch&uuml;tz wrote concerning W&uuml;rben, as though he were in
truth to be the companion of her life, and she winced under a
new note of familiarity which had crept into the attorney's
tone.</p>

<p>Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz, who had taken up his abode in
Wilhelmine's house at Schaffhausen, made matters worse by
what he conceived to be witty and subtle pleasantries. He
was never done with his allusions to 'mon cher futur beau
fr&egrave;re &agrave; Vienne,' and he playfully called his sister 'la petite
fianc&eacute;e.'</p>

<p>On a golden evening of late September, W&uuml;rben, accompanied
by Sch&uuml;tz, arrived at Schaffhausen. Wilhelmine and
Madame de Ruth saw the coach crawling up the steep incline
which led to the little castle that Zollern had given to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span>
favourite. With difficulty Madame de Ruth had induced
Wilhelmine to offer her future husband one day's hospitality.
The wedding was fixed for the morning after W&uuml;rben's arrival,
and the bridegroom had agreed to return to Vienna immediately
after the ceremony.</p>

<p>'I have the honour to present to you Monsieur le Comte
de W&uuml;rben!' said Sch&uuml;tz, as he ushered in the noble
Bohemian. W&uuml;rben bowed to the ground, and Wilhelmine
and Madame de Ruth bent in grand courtesies.</p>

<p>'Delighted to see you, mon cher! Welcome to our
family!' cried Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz ostentatiously, departing
entirely from the ceremonious code of those days, which
hardly permitted the nearest friends to greet each other
in this informal manner. But Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz prided
himself on his friendliness and geniality, and, like most
genial persons, he constantly floundered into tactlessness
and vulgarity. On this occasion his misplaced affability was
received with undisguised disapproval. Madame de Ruth
tapped him on the arm with her fan; Wilhelmine shot him a
furious, snake-like glance; W&uuml;rben himself looked surprised,
and merely responded with a bow to the effusive speech.
Sch&uuml;tz, of course, was the only one to whom it appeared
natural, nay, correct. In his world geniality, translated into
jocoseness, was indispensable before, during, and after a
wedding&mdash;even at these scarcely usual nuptials!</p>

<p>Now W&uuml;rben came forward. 'Mademoiselle de Gr&auml;venitz,'
he said, 'believe me, I am deeply sensible of the great honour
you will do me.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur, I thank you,' began Wilhelmine; but Friedrich
Gr&auml;venitz interposed pompously:</p>

<p>'As the head of the family, Monsieur, I wish to express to
you my pleasure at the thought of my sister bearing your
ancient name.'</p>

<p>'My name is much at Mademoiselle your sister's service,'
responded W&uuml;rben; and Madame de Ruth surprised a covert
sneer on the old rou&eacute;'s lips.</p>

<p>'Come, mes amis!' she cried, 'the travellers must be in
need of refreshment. Will you not repair to the guest-chamber,
gentlemen? and when you have removed the dust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
of travel from your clothes, we will partake of an early
supper.'</p>

<p>'Madame de Ruth, I will escort the gentlemen to their
apartments, if they wish it,' said Friedrich pompously,
opening his eyes wide in what he thought was a reproving
look, but in truth was only angrily foolish.</p>

<p>'Thank you, Friedrich. I will tell you when I wish your
assistance,' said Wilhelmine calmly. 'Dear Madame de Ruth,
you are right. I think Baron Sch&uuml;tz knows the way to the
guest-chamber? or shall I tell my brother to summon a lackey?'
Her tone was haughty to insolence. The irritation, the disgust,
the hatred of her odious though necessary plan, made her
mood evil. She was grateful to W&uuml;rben for his silence, and
his fine, if somewhat contemptuous manner, and she bestowed
a smile on him as he passed out of the room.</p>

<p>A constrained silence fell on the remaining three. Wilhelmine
leaned back in the chair into which she had sunk
directly Sch&uuml;tz and W&uuml;rben disappeared; her elbows rested on
the chair-arms, and her fingers were pressed together at the
points in an attitude of fastidious, artificial prayer. Madame
de Ruth fanned herself slowly and watched Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz,
who stood paring his nails with a small file he had
taken from his pocket.</p>

<p>'I certainly do not like your way towards me, Wilhelmine,'
he broke forth, puffing out his fine torso. 'You show a spirit
which is not nice towards the head of your family! I
think&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Dear Friedrich, if you could but realise that I do not
care what you think,' Wilhelmine interrupted icily.</p>

<p>'And your manner was not kind to W&uuml;rben&mdash;a nice man,
I like him!' said her brother in an almost ecstatic tone.</p>

<p>'How fortunate!' she called after Friedrich's retreating
figure, as he strode across the room with such pompous haste
that the affairs of the whole Empire might have waited his
directions.</p>

<p>The two ladies smiled at one another wearily when he had
gone; then, without honouring this self-sufficient person with
a word of comment, they fell to discussing W&uuml;rben. This
Bohemian nobleman was not an altogether unpleasing person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>ality.
Of middle height, he had a stoop which caused him to
appear short; it was not the stoop of the scholar, but that bend
which ill-health, caused by debauch, often gives to a comparatively
young man. His face was sallow, hollow beneath
the eyes, emaciated between chin and cheek-bone. The
brown eyes were feverishly bright and a trifle blood-shot.
The well-shaven mouth had loose, sensual lips, and the teeth
were large and discoloured. And yet one knew that this man,
repulsive though he had become, must have been a youth
of promise and some personal beauty; and his manner betokened
the man of breeding, and one with knowledge of the
great world. His sneer at the unholy bargain he was about
to make told Madame de Ruth that he was fully aware of
the degradation of it. An admirably adapted person for the
purpose, she reflected; for, being ashamed of his bargain, he
would hide in Vienna, content so long as he had sufficient
money to risk at l'hombre and faro. This she and Wilhelmine
discussed while Sch&uuml;tz and W&uuml;rben were upstairs
removing their dusty garments.</p>

<p>Suddenly Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz burst into the room. 'His
Highness has just ridden up to the door! This is really most
inconvenient, most difficult for me.' He spoke loudly.</p>

<p>'Hush! be careful! W&uuml;rben must not hear,' implored
Madame de Ruth, while Wilhelmine sprang up. She
breathed in laboured gasps, her eyes fixed wildly on her
brother.</p>

<p>'His Highness? You are mad, Friedrich! or is this some
absurd plot against me?' She turned on her brother fiercely.
'Is this some foolishness you have arranged?'</p>

<p>'It has nothing to do with me. I am never consulted,' he
began; but his further utterance was cut short, for Eberhard
Ludwig entered unannounced.</p>

<p>'Leave us together,' he said shortly. 'For God's sake,
Madame de Ruth, manage that I may speak with her undisturbed.'
Madame de Ruth hurried Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz away
with scant ceremony.</p>

<p>'My beloved! oh, to see you again!' Serenissimus clasped
her to him. 'Tell me you are mine, as you were at Urach!
Am I in time to hinder this terrible sacrilege?'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
She told him that the marriage had not yet taken place,
that it was for the morrow.</p>

<p>'It cannot be; you are my wife by the laws of God and
man! I cannot suffer you to be called the wife of another.
Tell me that you will not do this thing. Wilhelmine, my
beloved, you cannot&mdash;you cannot&mdash;&mdash;' He held her hand in
his, speaking rapidly, indistinctly.</p>

<p>'There is no other way,' she said sadly.</p>

<p>'But it is not possible! You cannot, it is a shameful thing.
I forbid you to do it. I will never leave you again. My son
may reign at Stuttgart. See, beloved, we will live here together&mdash;live
out our days in peace and love. It shall be a
poem, an idyll&mdash;far from all interruptions, far from intrigues!'</p>

<p>He looked into her face with shining eyes, but he found there
no answering spark of enthusiasm. Dropping her hand he
turned away. She was aghast. True, she loved Eberhard
Ludwig, but she realised at that moment how much more
potent was her love of splendour and power. What! to
drag out her life at Schaffhausen&mdash;even with him at her side?
No, it was impossible.</p>

<p>'Eberhard, be reasonable. This marriage is no marriage,
it is simply the purchase of a name. You know well enough
the conditions which are accepted by W&uuml;rben. Twenty
thousand gulden on the day of our contract, twelve thousand
gulden a year for his life. Various fine titles and court
charges, provided he undertakes never to appear in Stuttgart,
never to claim his marriage rights! He is to sign this
document in the presence of the lawyers to-morrow before
our&mdash;&mdash;' she hesitated, 'before our marriage.'</p>

<p>'But you will vow before God to love and obey this man;
you will give him your hand and kneel with him in prayer.
Something of the sanctity of our true vows will be filched
away. Sacred you are to me for ever, but oh! this will be
desecration! you cannot, you must not&mdash;&mdash;' he moaned.</p>

<p>'You knew this before. You knew and approved, and now
you hinder the completion of the only plan by which I can
return to you. You cannot give up your Dukedom, you cannot
leave Stuttgart, and we cannot live apart.' She spoke
harshly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<a href="./images/211.png">211</a>]</span>
'But is Stuttgart so much to you? Wilhelmine, do you
love me only as Duke of Wirtemberg?' His eyes were
full of tears. 'Alas! I am the most miserable of men.'</p>

<p>'Eberhard, heart of my life, look in my face and see if I
love you! But because I love you I dare not take you away
from your great position, from your ambition.'</p>

<p>'Ambition,' he broke in, 'ambition! I am ready to
renounce everything&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Will you let yourself sink into a mooning poet, my hero
of great battles? No! you shall go back, dear love&mdash;back to
your grand, soldier's life! See, I will stay here and dream
of you, if you will not let me take the only path back to
Wirtemberg. You shall write to me, sometimes send me a
poem, a jewel perhaps&mdash;but we shall be parted! O Eberhard!'
She sighed deeply, but her strange, hard eyes watched him
narrowly. He turned away his face. She saw that her
reminder of his military ambition had succeeded as she
expected.</p>

<p>'You are right. Alas! this horrible degradation, this masquerading
before God&mdash;and yet it is the only way.'</p>

<p>Her arms stole round him. Against his cheek he felt her
smooth skin, her warm lips sought his.</p>

<p>'I love you, only you,' she whispered. 'In a few days I
follow you to Stuttgart. Come to me!'</p>

<p>He flung her from him almost roughly.</p>

<p>'Not now! God in heaven! not now! Can you dream that
at such a time I could? It would make the hideous bargain
you contemplate to-morrow one degree more vile.' He turned
from her and fled. In a moment she heard the clatter of his
horse's hoofs in the courtyard.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE RETURN</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A travelling</span> coach and six horses thundered into Stuttgart,
driven at a hand gallop, and raised clouds of white dust as
it passed down the Graben. An escort of Silver Guards rode
with this coach. One of the soldiers' horses knocked over a
child playing in the roadway, but the cavalcade passed on
unheeding, leaving the little crushed figure lying limp and still
in the dust.</p>

<p>The coach drew up at the J&auml;gerhaus, where the doors
stood wide open, disclosing a company of servants drawn up
in solemn line. Two sentries were posted at either side
of the entrance. A black-clad major-domo bowed on the
threshold, while half a dozen lackeys sprang forward to receive
the tall woman who was slowly descending from the coach.
Madame la Comtesse de W&uuml;rben, her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin
of Wirtemberg, Countess Gr&auml;venitz, had arrived
at Stuttgart to attend to the duties connected with her invalid
husband's court charge.</p>

<p>This exalted lady was the first personage of the court
after the reigning Duchess, and his Highness had offered her
apartments in the castle, but these were refused, her Excellency
preferring to occupy an independent residence.</p>

<p>Thus it fell out that Wilhelmine returned to the J&auml;gerhaus
towards the end of September, some four months after she
had fled from Urach, and a few days since the mock marriage
with W&uuml;rben, 'ce cher Nepomuk, mon mari,' as she ironically
named him to Madame de Ruth.</p>

<p>There had been grievous storms at Stuttgart during the
days succeeding his Highness's return from hunting in the
Sch&ouml;nbuch, that shooting expedition which had been but a
pretext to leave Stuttgart and hurry to Schaffhausen, in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
to hinder the celebration of the ceremony of Wilhelmine's
marriage.</p>

<p>Serenissimus returned in a mood which would brook no
contradiction. He announced to the Geheimr&auml;the, and to the
court, that it was his pleasure to revive the ancient office of
Landhofmeister, and that he had conferred this, the highest
charge of his court, upon a Bohemian nobleman of the name
of W&uuml;rben, but that this gentleman being seriously indisposed,
his lady-wife had undertaken to fulfil the various duties of
Landhofmeisterin, and would reside at the J&auml;gerhaus. Private
information came to the astonished Geheimr&auml;the that this
new evil was but the old poison with a new label; that this
Countess W&uuml;rben was the hated Gr&auml;venitzin. Bitterly they
regretted their refusal of the two hundred thousand gulden,
but it was too late now.</p>

<p>To Johanna Elizabetha this announcement was made by
his Highness in person and with cruel frankness. She was
told that she had refused a life of ease and peace, leaving
his Highness to enjoy a happiness which she herself could
never have provided, and that he took this way to save himself
from despair, for without Wilhelmine he would not, nay,
could not, live.</p>

<p>'You must abide by this, Madame, and if you are peaceably
disposed, and behave with becoming consideration to her
Excellency the Landhofmeisterin, it will be possible for you
to remain in Stuttgart,' he told her.</p>

<p>Her Highness made no reply to this surprising speech, but
immediately wrote to Stetten, imploring the Duchess-mother
to come and put order into the family affairs. The dear
lady arrived in high dudgeon, and according to her custom
stated her opinion to Eberhard Ludwig in words he could
not misunderstand. But in vain, and it was a very
crestfallen, angry old lady who drove back through the fields
to Stetten.</p>

<p>The court was in a quandary, in comparison to which the
former perplexities in regard to the Gr&auml;venitzin were mere
bagatelles. If they refused to go to court festivities where
the Landhofmeisterin, after the Duchess, held the first rank,
they would risk being excluded from court perhaps for years<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>
Again, who knew how soon the favourite might fall into
disgrace, or be banished once more by some unexpected event?
There was much talk and fervid declarations of noble sentiments,
loyalty to the Duchess, love of purity, and the rest;
but when Wilhelmine invited the entire court to visit her at
the J&auml;gerhaus, on the occasion of a grand evening rout, it was
noticeable that those few who did not appear sent copious
excuses, pretending illness, and adding almost medical descriptions
of their ailments, so anxious were they that Wilhelmine
should believe them to be really indisposed! Already it was
considered dangerous to offend the Gr&auml;venitzin, as they still
called the Countess of W&uuml;rben, her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin,
but to her face she was 'your Excellency,' and
they paid her great court.</p>

<p>Naturally the Duchess Johanna Elizabetha held aloof, but
she knew she must one day meet her rival face to face, one
day take part in a court festivity where the woman would be
only second in formal rank, in reality the first in the estimation
of all.</p>

<p>The winter days grew short and dark, and Christmas
approached. Christmas rejoicings with this sinful woman
queening it at masque and dance! Even from informal family
gatherings the Landhofmeisterin, as first lady in the land,
could not be excluded.</p>

<p>'Dear and honoured Madame my Mother,' Johanna Elizabetha
wrote, 'I have to meet this woman again. Let the first
encounter not be before the world. I will invite her to our
Christmas tree. Come you too, dear Madame my Mother,
even if there is snow on the ground, to help your unhappy
daughter, Johanna Elizabetha.' Thus she wrote to the
formidable dame at Stetten.</p>

<p>It must be conceded that for the favourite this family
gathering to which she was bidden presented disagreeable
prospects of extreme difficulty, and she craved Eberhard Ludwig
to permit her to decline the honour, but Serenissimus implored
her to consent. It would be unwise to rebuff the Duchess's
overture, and after all, possibly it was her Highness's
intention to live peaceably with her husband's mistress.
Other ladies had done so. He quoted history and recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
events: Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>, Louise de la Valli&egrave;re, and Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se
of France, and so on. Also he represented to her that the
first meeting with Johanna Elizabetha would be a trifle
awkward with the whole court agape, so perhaps this private
family gathering was an excellent opportunity; besides, as
Landhofmeisterin, it was correct she should be included in
the Petit Cercle.</p>

<p>She mocked at the homely custom of the Christmas tree,
calling it unfitting for a grand seigneur's household to indulge
in such old-fashioned peasant-like rejoicings.</p>

<p>'Can you dream of such a festivity at Versailles?' she
asked, laughing.</p>

<p>He told her that his mother clung to the habit. It was an
ancient German custom thus to celebrate the Birth of Christ.</p>

<p>'I love the notion, too, that in all my villages the peasants
can have the same as I have, for once, poor souls!' he added
simply.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins>Eberhard, you are ridiculous!&mdash;yes, a ridiculous poet-fellow.
But I will come to your peasant celebration, if it
pleases you.' She was touched by this gentle saying of his.</p>

<p>And thus it fell out that on Christmas eve Wilhelmine ordered
her coach to convey her to the castle. She drove through the
snow in no happy frame of mind. Christmas trees and the
favourite!&mdash;could anything be more incongruous? and she
knew it. Angrily she sneered at the simple homeliness of
the old German custom. Peasants could do these absurdities,
but the Duchess of Wirtemberg?</p>

<hr />

<p>In the long room where the madrigals had been sung on
that well-remembered evening when Wilhelmine was installed
lady-in-waiting to her Highness, a tall fir-tree was planted
in a gilded barrel. A thousand twinkling lights burned on
the branches, and little trinkets dangled temptingly. Overhead,
on the topmost branch, the waxen Christmas angel with
tinsel wings hovered over this family gathering. Symbol of
peace and goodwill, this angel would look down pitifully on
the men and women round the Christmas tree, whose hearts
were full of bitterness, of envy and hatred! Lackeys were
fastening candles on to the branches, and Johanna Elizabetha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
and Madame de Stafforth were hanging up trinkets and playthings
for the Erbprinz.</p>

<p>The Duchess-mother entered. She glanced round the room.
'Has the enemy not arrived?' she said humorously.</p>

<p>Johanna Elizabetha sighed.</p>

<p>'No, she has not come yet. It is hard she should spoil our
Christmas Eve; but it is better than meeting her for the first
time as Landhofmeisterin with all her friends to stare at me.'</p>

<p>'She will not enjoy her evening, my dear,' returned the
Duchess-mother, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>At this moment Eberhard Ludwig entered, leading the
Erbprinz by the hand. He sometimes endeavoured to be a
kind father, but it was no easy matter for him. The Duchess-mother's
face softened as she greeted her son, and bent to
kiss the little boy, who scarcely responded to the old lady's
embrace. His shining, excited eyes were fixed upon the
Christmas tree, and snatching his hand from the Duke's grasp,
he began to dance round in frantic childish rapture. Johanna
Elizabetha forgot her troubles watching her son's joy, and she
commenced cutting off the playthings for him.</p>

<p>'It were fitting to await our guest's arrival, Madame, before
you strip the tree,' said the Duke coldly.</p>

<p>'Nonsense!' interrupted the Duchess-mother, 'surely
Elizabetha can give her child the playthings if she wishes to?'</p>

<p>'Her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin!' announced a page,
throwing open the door, and Wilhelmine appeared on the
threshold.</p>

<p>His Highness hurried forward to greet her, while Johanna
Elizabetha instinctively drew nearer to the Duchess-mother,
catching the Erbprinz by the arm.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine bent low in an elaborate courtesy. Her Highness
held out her hand shyly for her rival to kiss. The Duchess-mother
watched the comedy for an instant, then turning to
the Duke who stood behind Wilhelmine, nervously fingering
his rapier-hilt, she said:</p>

<p>'Serenissimus will have the kindness to present to
me the Landhofmeisterin, as I have not the pleasure to
know her.'</p>

<p>'Madame, my mother permits me&mdash;This is Madame la<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[<a href="./images/217.png">217</a>]</span>
Comtesse de W&uuml;rben, Landhofmeisterin,' he stammered, and
the Duchess-mother threw him a contemptuous glance.</p>

<p>'Ah, Madame de W&uuml;rben! how sad it must be for you to
be obliged to leave your husband in Bohemia,' she said. 'Have
you good news of him now? I am so interested in illness.
Tell me exactly what ails poor Count W&uuml;rben.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine stared at this formidable dame in consternation.
W&uuml;rben's fictitious ailments were difficult to name.</p>

<p>'He suffered&mdash;from&mdash;from&mdash;smallpox some years ago, your
Highness, and has never recovered his health,' she said haltingly.</p>

<p>'Ah! smallpox; yes, indeed, a terrible malady, and but too
common. Did your husband contract it at the same time
as you did, Madame? I see you must have been a great
sufferer,' said the Duchess-mother, fixing her sharp brown
eyes on the few hardly distinguishable pockmarks on Wilhelmine's
face. The favourite flushed.</p>

<p>'I was not married to Monsieur de W&uuml;rben at that time,
your Highness,' she answered.</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed! Madame, forgive me; I did not know how
long you had been married. Have you any children, Madame
de W&uuml;rben? No? Ah, a sad pity! The little ones would
doubtless have been a consolation to you while you are forced
to be absent from your husband; but perhaps we may have the
pleasure of seeing Monsieur de W&uuml;rben in Stuttgart before long?'</p>

<p>'I do not know, your Highness,' said Wilhelmine shortly.
Each word the Duchess-mother spoke cut her to the quick,
and she hated the tall, gaunt old lady as even she had never
hated before.</p>

<p>'Well, I hope for you sake, Madame, your husband will be
able to reside here soon. It is hard for a young woman
to be alone. And besides, really you should pray for a son
to succeed to the W&uuml;rben family honours. I used to know
a Count W&uuml;rben at Vienna many years ago. A Count
Nepomuk W&uuml;rben&mdash;'Nepi,' they called him&mdash;perhaps an uncle
of your husband's?'</p>

<p>'That is my husband's name, your Highness,' replied
Wilhelmine in a toneless voice.</p>

<p>'Impossible! Why, the man I mean will be sixty years old
by now, and he disgraced himself and squandered a fortune.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
No; that man cannot be your husband, dear Madame! I
heard he had made a fearful marriage&mdash;some adventuress who
had amassed money and wished for an old and honourable
name. It interests me much; pray ask your husband if that
W&uuml;rben was a cousin of his. A disagreeable subject though,
for, of course, no nobleman would care to own so vile a
person as cousin.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine threw up her head proudly. 'Your Highness,
Count Nepomuk W&uuml;rben is my husband, and I must request
you not to criticise him in my presence.'</p>

<p>Her spirit pleased the Duchess-mother, who replied in a
different tone: 'That then, Madame, is your misfortune. We
will not mention it again.'</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig during this painful scene stood in
embarrassed, angry silence. He durst not interfere, for knowing
his mother's character, he was well aware that any intervention
on his part would only draw down upon Wilhelmine
a flood of free-spoken remarks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other members of her Highness's intimate
circle had entered from a small withdrawing-room, leading out
of the larger apartment.</p>

<p>The Stafforths, Madame de Gemmingen, a young gentleman
of the household, Monsieur de R&ouml;der, and the Erbprinz's
governor, Monsieur le Baron de Walchingen, his tutor, and
various other unimportant persons. The Duke's mother and
Wilhelmine stood together in the centre of this group. The
older woman wore the sombre garb of a widow's mourning,
which she had never put off since Duke Wilhelm Ludwig's
death thirty years ago.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine was dressed, as usual, in delicate yellow
brocade with profusely powdered hair and flashing jewels.
They made a striking contrast&mdash;sober sadness and old age,
radiant youth and brilliant, lavish joy. And near by
was Johanna Elizabetha, clad in dull, unnoticeable garments
of grey blue silk. To Eberhard Ludwig the group was
symbolic of his life's history, and he sighed heavily as he
turned to greet Madame de Stafforth.</p>

<p>The Erbprinz, attracted by Wilhelmine's beautiful face
and bright clothes, had begged a paper flower from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
Christmas tree and offered it to her. Partly because she
loved to tease children, partly because the child's talk
made a diversion from the Duchess-mother's acid remarks,
Wilhelmine began bantering with the little boy, telling
him the wildest tales, witty absurdities, sheer delightful
fooling. The Erbprinz, accustomed to Johanna Elizabetha's
prim stories always adorned with obvious moral endings,
acclaimed Wilhelmine's phantasies with enthusiastic cries,
begging her to tell him more. He was fascinated, half-afraid,
puzzled, excited. Johanna Elizabetha watched this pair
with jealous, disapproving eyes, and several times called the
child away; but he shook his head, and holding on to
Wilhelmine's gown looked up into her face in rapturous
enjoyment and admiration of this beautiful new being and her
wonderful stories. At length her Highness could bear it no
longer. She approached the strangely assorted couple, and
drawing the Erbprinz to her she tried to fix his attention upon
the burning candles and glittering toys on the tree. But the
boy pushed her from him; he wanted to hear the lovely lady's
stories; they were much finer than any his mother ever told
him, he said. Johanna Elizabetha could stay and listen too,
if she liked, but she must not interrupt, he commanded. He
struggled from his mother's encircling arm and, drawing near
the favourite, he leaned his head against her, nestling close.
Wilhelmine, really touched by the child's confiding ways, bent
down to him and slipped her arm round his shoulders.</p>

<p>At this moment the Duchess-mother turning, saw the
unexpected sight of her grandson in the embrace of the
Gr&auml;venitz. She looked at them with stern disapproval. The
Erbprinz lifted his hand and stroked Wilhelmine's face. This
was too much for Johanna Elizabetha. She sprang forward
like a tigress defending her young, and snatched the boy away
from Wilhelmine. Immediately the delicate, over-excitable
child set up a wailing cry; he wanted to stay with the lovely
lady who told such diverting stories, he said. Johanna
Elizabetha in vain endeavoured to soothe him. Now the
Duchess-mother bore down on the group and commenced rating
the child for his disobedience. Johanna Elizabetha, emboldened
by the old lady's approach, turned fiercely upon Wilhelmine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
'You have frightened my boy with your horrible stories!'
she cried, and dragged the wailing Erbprinz towards the
door; but he resisted manfully, crying that he would stay with
the lovely lady. His granddame caught him, and bestowed
a ringing box on his ear. The child raised a very tempest of
sobs, and flinging off his mother's arm, fled howling towards
Wilhelmine. Johanna Elizabetha, beyond herself with anger
and disgust, horrified at the notion of the child being brought
into contact with the woman she regarded as debased, rushed
forward and, pulling the child violently away, she cried wildly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do not touch her; it is not fitting!'</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig, who had been conscientiously conversing
with the few guests, hurried up.</p>

<p>'What is this?' he asked angrily. 'Madame, why does
your son howl like a beggar's brat?'</p>

<p>The Duchess-mother came forward. 'A sorry spectacle,
indeed,' she said grimly. 'The Landhofmeisterin, not being
used to children, has frightened the Erbprinz.'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,' broke in Wilhelmine, white to the lips,
'I crave permission to depart at once. I am not well.'</p>

<p>'Not well, Madame?' cried the Duke in an anxious tone;
'let me escort you immediately to your coach.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine bowed to the two Duchesses, but her salute
remained unacknowledged.</p>

<p>A petty social annoyance, a commonplace occurrence of
disagreeable import, a moment's pique, have often brought
about historic changes, the real cause whereof lies deep
in the secret working of men's hearts and can only be
understood by each one to himself. Thus in Wirtemberg's
eighteenth-century record, the homely, unpleasant, trifling
scene on Christmas Eve wrought a change in the history,
destined to influence the affairs of the country for many
years.</p>

<p>The Gr&auml;venitz returned to the J&auml;gerhaus profoundly
humiliated, deeply wounded. The Duchess-mother's remarks
had been embarrassing and painful; each word as a finger
of scorn pointed at that disgraceful bargain with W&uuml;rben,
at the recollection whereof Wilhelmine winced. But when
Johanna Elizabetha snatched the Erbprinz away from her as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>
though her very touch was contamination for the child, her
whole being had shuddered with the ignominy. She knew herself
to be accounted vile, one of the outcasts from whose proximity
every virtuous woman must shrink and instinctively seek to
protect all she loves, all she esteems pure. There is a terrible
anguish to the outcast woman in this withdrawal from her
of a child. Suddenly, she learns to measure her shame with
a new gauge: by the lofty instinct of a mother's reverence
for her child's fair innocence. Then the pariah realises that
she is thrust beyond the pale of human purity. She has
chosen the black mud of vice as her portion, and her presence
reeks; she is tainted, and may not approach the pure.</p>

<p>If in the stillness of that Christmas night Wilhelmine,
realising this, agonised, as countless women have realised and
suffered, the next morning she showed no sign of the night's
anguish. Unless her mood of unrelenting decision was the
outcome thereof.</p>

<p>She had decided to present to Eberhard Ludwig two alternatives:
either Johanna Elizabetha must retire to a dower-house,
leaving the favourite mistress of Stuttgart, or the court of
Wirtemberg must follow their Duke and the Landhofmeisterin
to T&uuml;bingen, Urach, or wherever it suited her to direct, leaving
the Duchess in a mournful, deserted Stuttgart.</p>

<p>In any case, it must be provided that no possibility should
exist of an humiliation such as she had suffered on the
preceding evening. And as she intended to remain at the
head of Wirtemberg's court, it was imperative Johanna Elizabetha
should be removed. Murder no longer being politic&mdash;the
Emperor had frightened the Gr&auml;venitz off that track&mdash;it
remained to devise some other scheme whereby the Duchess
could be rendered unobnoxious.</p>

<p>Upon Eberhard Ludwig's arrival at the J&auml;gerhaus, he was
immediately informed of his mistress's decision. Again a
small event precipitated the formation of an important plan.
Johanna Elizabetha had wept incessantly during the Christmas
Eve supper, and the Duchess-mother's sharp tongue had
rasped the Duke's irritable nerves till he had lost control of
his temper and had roughly bidden his wife and mother to
leave him in peace. There had followed a painful scene. Thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
his Highness was well disposed towards any scheme which
would release him from his inharmonious family circle. Yet
he hesitated to acquiesce in the daring project of the entire
removal from Stuttgart of court and government. Wirtemberg
had been governed at Stuttgart, and the chief ducal residence
had been there since the twelfth century. As to Johanna
Elizabetha's retirement to a dower-house he reminded
Wilhelmine that the proposal had been made, and that the
Duchess's answer was decisive: so long as she did not mourn
her husband's death she would remain in residence at Stuttgart's
castle. The Duke added that he had no power to force
her to leave.</p>

<p>Serenissimus and the Landhofmeisterin were together in
the famous yellow damask room of the J&auml;gerhaus. The
blue-tiled stove radiated a pleasant warmth, and from the
windows the lovers could see the snow-covered Graben,
the main thoroughfare of the town. The cheerful jingle of
sleigh-bells rang out as the peasants' sledges glided over
the snow. The Christmas Day service in the Leonards Kirche
had ended, and the traditional dole of silver pieces had been
distributed in the Duke's name, an old custom of medi&aelig;val
times.</p>

<p>It was one of those absolutely still winter mornings, so
fraught with peace, so purified by the great white silence of
snow. Something of the artificial elegance, the stilted formality
of the eighteenth century with its scrupulous apeing
of French airs, mannerisms, and vices, seemed to fall from the
lovers in the J&auml;gerhaus, and for an hour they dreamed of
simple natural homely peace. Alas! their dream was of such
a life together. Like most dreams it was based on an
impossibility.</p>

<p>A peasant couple in a sledge passed the window. The
man, a sturdy, thick-set figure in the Wirtemberg peasant's
short, well-fitting, dark-blue coat, adorned with rows of round
knob silver buttons. He wore a peaked fur cap drawn down
over the ears. The woman was in a thick blue frieze cape
and elaborate Sunday headdress. She had slipped her hand
through her husband's arm and they were talking gaily
together. Eberhard Ludwig pointed towards them and a
sigh escaped his lips.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
'There is the peace of two loving hearts. They are happier
than we, for their love is duty, their duty love,' he said sadly.</p>

<p>'Alas!' she answered; but she knew that for her such
peace was not, and that she would not have wished for it; yet
a regret smote her, a yearning to be all she was not. And
with this pang came the bitter recollection of her painful
humiliation. Her face hardened. 'That happiness is only
possible in the protection of the strong,' she said. 'Do you
think yonder peasant would suffer his beloved to be scorned,
to be insulted? The Duke of Wirtemberg alone cannot protect
the woman he loves.'</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig drew back from her.</p>

<p>'How cruel you are, dear heart,' he said, and a great sadness
lay in his voice. She told him that the truth was often cruel to
hear; that she but spoke these things because he let himself
drift into weak conniving at the intrigues of Johanna Elizabetha.
Then she recounted the petty spite and the thousand taunts
to which she was subjected. She painted Stuttgart in sombre
colours, the dullness, the stiffness. Why should Wirtemberg
be the least brilliant, least gay, of all the German courts?
She talked of Berlin and the splendours of the newly made
King Frederick <span class="smcap">i.</span> Of Dresden with the Elector-King of
Poland, Augustus the Strong; of his splendid residence, the
Zwinger, which, like an enchanted palace, had been built in
so short a span, and to whose marvels each day was added a
wonderful chamber, a gilded dome, or a fair work of art.</p>

<p>Why should not peace and happiness reign in Wirtemberg
with splendour and gaiety? Why should not a gracious
palace rise to rival even the glories of Versailles? She drew
the picture with sure strokes, each word an added colour in
the vision of a life of tranquil yet brilliant ease and distinguished
magnificence.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig, caught by the flame of her eloquence,
flared into enthusiasm, and they fell to discussing which town
or castle should be the chosen spot for their new court.
Urach, T&uuml;bingen, Wildbad, all were reviewed. They spoke
no longer of whether the great flitting should take place; it
was now merely a question of where and how it should be
accomplished. From which it may be seen that Wilhelmine,
as usual, had won the day.</p>

<p>'And pile him a palace straight, to pleasure the Princess he loved.'</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="tr"><span class="smcap">Abt Vogler.</span></p>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> leagues north of Stuttgart, in the heart of the forest,
stood the small hunting castle, the Erlachhof, whither
Eberhard Ludwig often fled from the world and for many
peaceful days lived the life of hunter. In these woods he
wandered in early spring, here on summer nights he had slept
beneath the trees, dreaming the dreams of his poet nature.</p>

<p>The Erlachhof had been greatly rebuilt, his Highness
having commanded many alterations and improvements in
the old castle. Since the year 1704 the various works had
progressed right well. The gardens were already famous far
and wide, and all Europe had added to their wealth: tulips
from Holland, carnations and roses from France, oleanders
and passion-flowers from Italy, while Spain had furnished
orange-trees and myrtles. And here it was that Wilhelmine
decided the great palace should be built.</p>

<p>The Erlachhof, from a gentle, simple, old-world German
maiden, was to be transformed into a queen among palaces.
Thus the daring favourite willed it: a princely pleasure-house
to rival Versailles.</p>

<p>The Italian architect Frisoni was called. An artist of no
mean merit, and pupil of Jules Hardouin Mansard, the chief
architect of Versailles, where Frisoni had worked at the plans
together with his master. The Italian arrived: a small, dapper
man, ridiculous in his huge powdered wig, his little brown
monkey face peering out of the curled white locks. Her
Excellency desired a palace on the same model as the fine
French palazzo? Nothing easier! No? An original design,
then, but of that style? Ah! more facile still! Cost? A
trifle to so noble and magnificent a prince as Monseigneur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>
Altissimo the Duke of Wirtemberg. One almost expected
the vast structure to rise from the ground in a night, so easy
did it seem from the man's account!</p>

<p>The German gentlemen employed at the Erlachhof were
deposed from power, and their dominion given over to Frisoni.
Never was there such a stir in Wirtemberg. All the quarries
rendered stone. Each village sent its most skilled workmen,
and Frisoni despatched messengers to Italy to summon
all the disengaged talent to the tremendous enterprise. In
swarms they arrived&mdash;black-browed, olive-skinned, chattering
like apes. And the little monkey in the flowing white
peruke took direction. But first, the spiritual needs of the
workmen must be considered; and the Gr&auml;venitz, raging with
impatience in Stuttgart, was forced to look on while a
Catholic chapel was built near the Erlachhof, ere ever the
palace was begun.</p>

<p>The Wirtemberg workmen murmured, grumbled, finally
mutinied. They would not work with chattering idolaters.</p>

<p>'Let them go, the German louts,' said Frisoni; 'I have
better workmen in Italy.' So a new army arrived.</p>

<p>'Popery in our midst! The witch is bringing back Antichrist
to Wirtemberg!' said Stuttgart.</p>

<p>The Geheimr&auml;the informed Serenissimus that Frisoni's
monetary demands were excessive. Forstner was despatched
to look into the affair. He was appointed Grand Master of
the works. Frisoni raged. The gulden had a way of flowing
into Forstner's pocket, and, so Frisoni vowed, but few came
out again.</p>

<p>Constantly the Duke and the Landhofmeisterin thundered
up to the Erlachhof in their coach and six. Three times a
week the favourite flew into a passion and rated Forstner for
the tardiness of the building. He referred her to Frisoni,
who referred her back to the Grand Master of the works.
The plans were completed, the men worked hard, yet delays
were frequent, he owned; but the builders, knowing themselves
worthy of their hire, struck work when they went
unpaid.</p>

<p>'Unpaid?' roared the Duke; 'when I have disbursed four
hundred thousand gulden?'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
'Look into the matter, your Highness, and you will know,<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins>
answered the architect.</p>

<p>Forstner was arraigned at Stuttgart. He arrived, accompanied
by a secretary and several big ledgers. The accounts
seemed in order, certainly.</p>

<p>'Justice!' implored poor Forstner, 'for my honour as a
gentleman!'</p>

<p>'Ask the workmen!' shrieked Frisoni, and they summoned
a deputation of the Italian stone-cutters. They swore they
had not been paid for months. The Madonna and all the
saints knew how they starved.</p>

<p>'Where <i>is</i> the money?' asked the perplexed Duke, and
was answered by so many contending truths from each side
that he could but be aware that some one, many, or all
parties were lying.</p>

<p>Obviously some one must be removed in order to simplify
this tangle, but who? 'Who is guilty?' mourned Serenissimus.
The Landhofmeisterin's argument was clear enough:
'We cannot waste time in seeking the criminal. Some one has
to disappear from the scene; exit therefore the least useful!
Probably Frisoni lies, but he is an admirable architect.
Surely the Italian workmen lie; they do not look like starving
creatures, but they are wonderful masons. Forstner is of no
use to me; on the contrary, he incommodes me with his
virtuous reasonings. Therefore, exit Forstner!'</p>

<p>'My honour is wounded, I will depart!' wailed this estimable
personage; and he forthwith craved Eberhard Ludwig's
permission to leave Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>'God speed you hence!' cried the Landhofmeisterin;
and Forstner departed, thinking he went of his own free
will.</p>

<p>'My four hundred thousand gulden!' bewailed Serenissimus.</p>

<p>'Procure more from the Geheimr&auml;the, and refuse to pay
arrears to the workmen,' counselled Wilhelmine. Which
course being adopted and peacefully accepted by the Italians,
it would look as though they had, in truth, received their due.
But no one has ever known where went the four hundred
thousand gulden.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>
Forstner retired to Strassburg, and for several years there
was no word of him.</p>

<p>The building at the Erlachhof went on apace now. Gulden
flowed regularly and without stint, and each day more
foreigners arrived to give their talents in return for broad
gold pieces. Painters, sculptors, gilders came from north
and south, and the Wirtembergers looked on aghast. Then
was issued an astounding order. His Highness commanded
some seven hundred of Stuttgart's rich merchants and burghers,
also each trade guild in the country, to construct at their
expense a number of houses near the Erlachhof. In this
arbitrary decree, for the first time, the new palace was officially
styled Ludwigsburg, after its lavish creator, Eberhard Ludwig.</p>

<p>The guilds of trade protested loudly, asking what it would
advantage them to have houses in Ludwigsburg. The merchants
and burghers followed suit. They received scant
consideration of their protest. If they would not obey, his
Highness would find himself compelled to levy a tax upon
them. A tribute so exorbitant as to cripple them for years;
whereas did they obey, he promised to purchase each mansion
which the builder did not desire to inhabit. It was the better
way, and forthwith the building began. But there was a
further clause in the ducal mandate: the houses must be constructed
according to Frisoni's plans and drawings, approved
by his Highness. Again the burghers protested, but they
were silenced by the Duke's promise to purchase.</p>

<p>Not only was a magnificent palace to be erected, but a
town was to be conjured up as well, and from Frisoni's plans
it appeared that it was to be a town of courtiers' houses.
Bitter discontent reigned at Stuttgart, and the guards round
the J&auml;gerhaus were doubled.</p>

<p>But there was rejoicing in the Gr&auml;venitz camp. Things
were going admirably for the satellites, the grasping, hungry
parasites. Madame de Ruth and Zollern alone might have
spoken some moderating word, but the old courtesan was
swept off her feet by Wilhelmine's brilliancy, and Zollern
dreamed of Ludwigsburg as a new Catholic centre.</p>

<p>Time did not hang heavy on Wilhelmine's hands during
the years which elapsed ere the Corps de Logis and the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>
small pavilions at Ludwigsburg were completed. In spite
of the frantic haste with which the work was carried on, it
was found impossible for the Duke to take up his residence
in his new palace till the spring of 1711.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a new project engrossed the Landhofmeisterin's
attention. Although she fully intended to occupy the palace
itself, she deemed it expedient to possess an independent
castle at Ludwigsburg, and on the foundations of the Schafhof,
another small hunting lodge near the old Erlachhof, she caused
a miniature summer palace to be erected. This she named
La Favorite. It was constructed according to a plan in
Mansard's 'Ch&acirc;teaux Joyeux.'</p>

<p>The Schafhof had been connected with the Erlachhof by a
magnificent avenue of chestnut-trees, which remained for the
most part intact save where a few trees had been cut to leave
space for the fine terracing on the north side of the new Corps
de Logis of Ludwigsburg. Still there was a shady avenue,
commencing from the lowest terrace and following the gentle
rise of the ground up to the Schafhof. This avenue she of
course retained, merely causing the branches to be cut back,
in order to leave an unbroken view of La Favorite from the
windows of the Corps de Logis.</p>

<p>A host of gardeners laboured at the wood round the
Ch&acirc;teaux Joyeux, turning the rough ground into a series of
gracious flowering parterres.</p>

<p>The interior of Wilhelmine's little palace was a dream of
beauty. Every room was panelled in white, and each panel
encircled by a graceful design in gold, which terminated in
gorgeous devices on the ceilings. For the most part the
rooms were curtained with the Gr&auml;venitz yellow. The floors
were a triumph of the wood-inlayer's art, the chairs and tables
were of gilt or of inlaid rosewood. It was a house of sunshine:
all Wilhelmine's windows looking full southward or
westward, while on the colder north and east sides were the
domestics' apartments.</p>

<p>At length, in the July of 1711, the Corps de Logis and the
small adjoining pavilions were ready for occupation, and the
long eastern and western side-wings were so nearly completed
that it was possible to lodge the chief personages of the court,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>
and the army of serving men and women. The garden
terracing was terminated, and the water for the numerous
fountains laid on.</p>

<p>La Favorite was ready for its capricious namesake, and the
town of Ludwigsburg counted some two hundred new houses.
The old posting inn, formerly a dilapidated peasant's habitation,
barnlike and unpromising enough to the traveller, had
become a fine mansion with many guest chambers. The
peasant innkeeper, who regarded every foreigner as an intruder,
was replaced by a magnificent gentleman with condescending
manners.</p>

<p>Enterprising venders of all sorts hurried to the new centre
of opulence. Already an obsequious personage from Paris
had taken up his abode in a room of one of the new houses,
and a painted board hanging from his window informed the
passers-by that he was permitted to style himself Coiffeur
to her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin, to Serenissimus the
Duke, and to the court in general. Along with this gentleman
arrived several spruce ladies, one of whom was reported
to be his wife, but opinions varied as to which of the eight
possessed this honour. These demoiselles were expert dressmakers,
and plied many other trades necessary for the beautifying
of court ladies. A French corset-maker appeared on the
scene, and a famous vender of cosmetics. In fact, there were
not wanting all the elements which must ever be at hand for
serving the whimsies and necessities of noble dames. The
titles of these court purveyors were in the Landhofmeisterin's
keeping, and were only procurable by payment of a good
round sum.</p>

<hr />

<p>The sun was sinking in a glory over the grim mount of
Hohenasperg, that sinister, frowning fortress-prison which
threatened conveniently near to Ludwigsburg, ready to lodge
those unfortunate enough to incur the displeasure of Serenissimus,
or, more accurately, of her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin.
The departing sun left a flaming radiancy which
hung over the 'mansard&eacute;' roofs of Ludwigsburg, and was
reflected again and again in the waters of the hundred garden
fountains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
All day a hurrying stream of vehicles had rumbled into the
courtyard, setting down the servants and effects of his Highness
of Wirtemberg, and of the lady who ruled his destiny.
Frisoni was in a mighty pother; he ran round the room
excitedly, moving a chair, smoothing out a fold in the curtains,
drawing a table to another position. He hopped hither and
thither like some gay little monkey. Suddenly a tremendous
shout went up from the three thousand Italian workmen
who had been permitted to assemble near the gilded gates to
witness the arrival of the court.</p>

<p>First came a large detachment of the Silver Guard, which
were to take up quarters in the newly completed barracks at
Ludwigsburg. Then followed a company of Cadets &agrave; Cheval,
two hundred youths of noble family attired in crimson uniforms
with black velvet slashings and silver braidings. After
these rode an hundred equerries to his Highness, uniformed
in light blue with silver facings. Then came a file of richly
painted coaches conveying the holders of court charges, each
coach escorted by four mounted troopers. Then the musicians
on white horses with gorgeous red velvet and gold trappings.
A second detachment of the Silver Guard numbering about
five hundred, and at last the great gilded coach and six hove
into sight. On both sides rode Cadets &agrave; Cheval, their ordinary
crimson and black slashed uniforms embellished by short
cloaks of silver cloth, which fell from each youth's shoulders
on to the horse's haunches. In the coach sat his Highness on
the left, and the Landhofmeisterin on the right, the seat which
custom, etiquette, and morality set apart for the Duchess,
who, poor soul, mourned in solitude at Stuttgart, while her
place in the pageant was taken by the beautiful, evil woman,
Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz. But oh! how lovely she was, this
adventuress! She looked indeed well fitted to be the chief
personage of this magnificence. Her garments, as usual, were
of golden yellow; on her flowing, powdered curls she wore a
little round hat with a waving white plume, fastened by a
diamond clasp. On her breast glittered the broad riband and
the white enamel stag, whose antlers bore the diamond cross
of the order of St. Hubertus. The little hat was strangely
like a crown; the baton of the Landhofmeisterin's office, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
she held in her hand, resembled a sceptre: it was of gold, and
ablaze with precious stones. A travesty, no doubt, an absurdity,
an insolence, but how fine it all looked! The Duke wore a
white satin long-coat, embroidered with gold, and on his breast
shone the St. Hubertus stag and cross. Truly the prince of
some fable, seated beside a gorgeous princess.</p>

<p>Behind the golden coach followed two hundred life guards,
uniformed in white and silver, and with drawn swords. Then
came his Highness's forest guards, in green, with silver bandoliers
and hunting horns, each with the white St. Hubertus stag
and cross embroidered large upon the breast. After these rode
the court pages, the Duke's secretaries, the officers of the household.
And finally, three companies of the Wirtemberg regiments
which had fought at Blenheim under Eberhard Ludwig.</p>

<p>A crowd of peasants from neighbouring villages had
gathered outside the gates of Ludwigsburg; they raised a
shout when they saw their Duke. He bowed, and the Landhofmeisterin
also bent her head in dignified salutation.
Immediately the shouting ceased, and a low ominous groan
went up, intermingled with sibilant hissings. Wilhelmine
grew pale, and shot a glance of hatred towards the peasants.
His Highness spoke rapidly in a low tone to the cadet who
rode at his elbow. The youth galloped back along the line
of the cort&egrave;ge, and delivered an order to the captain of the
1st Regiment of Wirtemberg Cavalry. And as the gilded
coach rolled in at the palace gates, Wilhelmine heard with
satisfaction the howls and curses of the peasant crowd, which
was being dispersed by the soldiers' swords.</p>

<p>When the Landhofmeisterin entered the palace of Ludwigsburg,
the military brass instruments and drums in the courtyard
ceased playing, and as the lovers passed over the
threshold a strain from graceful, delicate, stringed instruments
greeted them.</p>

<p>'Welcome to our house of harmony!' whispered Serenissimus,
bending to kiss his mistress's hand.</p>

<p>Slowly and with dignity they were led by Frisoni through
the beautiful rooms&mdash;the huge, gilded banqueting hall, the
ball-rooms, the withdrawing-rooms, the picture-gallery, the
audience-chamber, the card-rooms, the theatre. The little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
Italian caught the note of Wilhelmine's ceremony, and he
showed Ludwigsburg to her as though she were a princess
bride, entering for the first time the palace of her new
dominions, instead of an enterprising mistress, part designer
and wholly inspirer of each nook and corner of a nation's ruin
in stone and marble.</p>

<p>They passed up the broad white marble staircase, and
Frisoni solemnly conducted them to his Highness's private
apartments&mdash;the antechamber, the audience-closet, the
writing-room, and the sleeping-room.</p>

<p>'The apartments of her Excellency are situated in the
west pavilion. If your Highness wishes to inspect them
we must pass downstairs once more, to gain the entrance to
the pavilion,' he said gravely.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig, smiling, bade him lead the way, though,
of a truth, he knew a shorter way by a small door leading
through the statue gallery directly from his apartments to
the decorously closed pavilion.</p>

<p>In solemn procession, Serenissimus leading the Landhofmeisterin,
preceded by Frisoni as guide, passed down the chief
stair, and from the lower antehall to the door of the west
pavilion. Here were the apartments of the great Landhofmeisterin.
On the ground floor the room for her personal
attendant, the wardrobe-room, her Excellency's library and
business-room, where the various affairs of the Landhofmeisterin's
office were to be transacted. Then up a narrow
stair to the first floor to a large antechamber, a sleeping-room,
a private writing-room, and above another small stair
leading to the powdering-room.</p>

<p>All these rooms were little masterpieces of various arts,
chief among which that of the wood-inlayer&mdash;the floors, the
walls, the doors being profusely inlaid with precious woods.
Everywhere the arms of Wirtemberg were interwoven with
the W&uuml;rben and Gr&auml;venitz devices, and with the emblems of
the chase and of music&mdash;symbols of the Duke-hunter and
his beloved musician-mistress.</p>

<p>The courtiers who followed his Highness and the Landhofmeisterin
expressed their admiration discreetly, Zollern and
Madame de Ruth leading the chorus of approval.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
At length the ceremonious inspection was concluded, and
the courtiers hurried away to view their own quarters, leaving
her Excellency in the pavilion, and Serenissimus in his
sumptuous Corps de Logis.</p>

<p>When the courtiers' steps ceased to echo in the corridor,
Wilhelmine drew a little golden key from her bosom and,
approaching a panel in the antechamber wall on the first floor,
fitted it into a keyhole which was artfully hidden in the intricacies
of the inlaid design. She turned the lock and a small
door flew open. She stepped through and found herself in the
corridor of statues. Directly facing the hidden panel door
she found another similar lock masked beneath the outstretched
hand of one of the many plaster Amorini. Here
again a small door sprang open beneath her touch, and she
entered the Duke's sitting-room. Her entry, however, was
further hidden by an arras of Gobelin tapestry fitted on a
wooden partition running down one side of his Highness's
room. At the end nearest the entrance to his sleeping-chamber,
a small portion of this partition flew back upon
touching a spring, and revealed a narrow doorway. Little
wonder that both Eberhard Ludwig and Wilhelmine smiled
when the Italian conducted them down and up the staircases
and through innumerable rooms ere they reached the apartments
of the Landhofmeisterin!</p>

<p>Serenissimus was standing at the window of his writing-room
overlooking the courtyard. In his hand was a closely
written page, and his face wore a look of distress and perplexity.
He turned sharply when he heard Wilhelmine's step,
and, flushing deeply, he crushed the paper into the breast of
his coat. She was quick to note the movement, and the
Duke's evident embarrassment.</p>

<p>'A letter, Monseigneur, which you would hide from me?'
she said. Like most women in illegitimate positions she was
easily suspicious, and all letters, petitions, every scrap of
paper destined for her lover, were carried for inspection to
the omnipotent Landhofmeisterin ere they were permitted
to reach their destination.</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame, a letter from a private friend,' returned the
Duke, his embarrassment turning to anger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
'Ah! something not intended for me? I crave your
Highness's forgiveness. I came to say a word of my great
happiness in being indeed installed in our House of Harmony,'
she sneered bitterly, and turning, would have hurried
back to her apartments; but Serenissimus followed her, and
laying his hand on her arm drew her towards him.</p>

<p>'There are things in each life which can never be told.
Beloved, there is a seal on my lips which honour has
impressed with her fair image. I cannot tell you what is in
this letter. Believe me, it is no pleasant thing that I hide
from you; it would not make you happy to read these lines.
Also, they are unimportant, for I do not heed them.'</p>

<p>She prayed him to tell her. How could she rest if she
knew he had a thought apart from her? It gave her anxiety,
she said, that it was something disagreeable. She used all
her arts of attraction, of seduction, but he remained obdurate.
Then she flamed into anger and left him with a bitter word.</p>

<p>To celebrate his Highness's entry into Ludwigsburg, a
masked ball had been commanded to take place on the evening
following the arrival of the court. The Duke and his
mistress met at supper after the episode of the letter, but the
Landhofmeisterin avoided his Highness's eye and seemed
absorbed in conversation with Zollern. During the evening she
played faro at her own table, and early took her leave, pleading
that she was fatigued. On the morning of the masked
ball his Highness attended a stag-hunt, and thus it fell out
that he and Wilhelmine did not meet to discuss the vexed
question of the letter.</p>

<p>The beautiful ballroom at Ludwigsburg was brilliantly
illuminated by a thousand waxen tapers which burned in the
huge crystal chandeliers. The Landhofmeisterin's own musicians
discoursed rhythmical strains from the gallery, and a gay
motley crowd moved on the inlaid polished floor. There were
dominoes of every colour, bizarre, fantastic shapes; and somehow
this masked assemblage had a strangely sinister appearance,
a mysterious lurking menace seemed to emanate from it.</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin was easily recognisable from her
great height. For a moment she had contemplated dressing
in man's clothes, but Serenissimus had dissuaded her. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span>
Duke's domino was of 'Gr&auml;venitz yellow' of the same hue as
that of the Landhofmeisterin. Madame de Ruth had refused
to go masked.</p>

<p>'My old face is mask enough,' she said; and Zollern,
delighted to escape the ordeal of a travesty, had declared he
would keep his old friend company. So the two sat together
and made merry over the grotesque appearance of the other
guests.</p>

<p>At first, many had approached the undominoed couple
and, under cover of carnival licence, some had ventured to say
sharp things to the old courtesan, but each in turn retired
discomfited before the sting of Madame de Ruth's quick wit.
The Landhofmeisterin stood near to her friend. She felt
strangely lonely in this disguised crowd, and Serenissimus
held aloof from her. She saw him exchanging compliments
with a light blue domino, from whose supple movements
Wilhelmine guessed to be a young and graceful woman.</p>

<p>A sudden wave of jealous fear invaded the Landhofmeisterin's
heart. And leaving her safe place behind Madame de Ruth
and Zollern, she walked out into the crowd of revellers.
Instantly several masks left the dancing, laughing, whirling
main stream and approached the newcomer. 'Fair mask, come
tread a measure!' 'Do you seek love or amusement here?'
and many other meaningless absurdities were squeaked into
her ear by some unwary ones who had not recognised the
much-feared Landhofmeisterin in the tall yellow-clad figure.
She shot a glance of contempt at her interlocutors and
pushed past them. Of a sudden she was surrounded by a
circle of red-garbed gnomes who danced round her. 'Let me
pass, good people,' she said; and when they would not, she
broke through the chain of their arms and hurried on. They
would have followed, but a black mask caught the ringleader
and whispered in his ear, and the laughing gnomes fell back
murmuring together.</p>

<p>The Duke was still dallying with the blue domino; Wilhelmine
saw him lead her to one of the windows which opened
out on to the terraces. She followed swiftly, hardly hearing the
comments and whispers of the revellers who took this occasion
to convey insulting words to the hated woman. As she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
reached the window in whose balcony she knew her lover to
be, she felt a hand on her arm. She turned angrily.</p>

<p>'What do you want? how dare you hinder me?' she said.
It was a tall, thin domino who accosted her, entirely black, and
with a skull and crossbones embroidered in white upon the
breast. A startling figure, and to Wilhelmine's overwrought
nerves it seemed to be the figure of Death come to snatch her
life's glory and happiness from her in this her triumph of the
completion of the palace.</p>

<p>'What do you want of me?' she said again, conquering her
superstitious fear.</p>

<p>'I would speak to you, Madame; I have a warning to give
you.' The voice was deep and low, and after the squeaky
tones which the revellers affected in order to disguise their
natural voices, this man's bass notes sounded hollow and
funereal.</p>

<p>'Speak then here,' she answered.</p>

<p>'No; my warning must be given to you where none can
hear,' he responded; and once more laying his black-gloved
hand on her arm, he drew her away from the window towards
a door which led down a short flight of steps into the moonlit
garden. Did the man mean murder? It flashed across
Wilhelmine that she was going blindly into danger. She
paused on the topmost step of the flight.</p>

<p>'I will go no further; speak now, or I leave you here.'
Her voice was calm, though her hands were trembling a little.</p>

<p>'I am sent to tell you that your hour has come; that your
ill-gotten power, your evil triumphs, are waning.' His voice
was deep, sonorous, impressive.</p>

<p>'Who sends you?' she asked. Coming from the brilliantly
lit rooms and the stir and noise of the ball, this
sudden interlude in the still, moonlit garden, with the strange,
sinister, black-robed figure, seemed to her like a dream.</p>

<p>'I am sent by one you have ruined, in the name of the
many you have injured! and yet, in mercy, I bid you fly
while there is time!' the stranger answered.</p>

<p>'Ah! Mercy? This is some absurd fiction; no one has
mercy upon me,' she said bitterly.</p>

<p>'Yes, I have. I came to deliver my message, and yester<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>day
I saw your entry into Ludwigsburg. I saw the peasants
cruelly driven back by the soldiers' swords. I saw the great
monument you have raised here to your shame, this mad,
mock court of yours, and I hated you! but then I saw your
youth, your beauty, and I vowed I would warn you, that you
might carry this, your true wealth, to some atonement for
your sins. I bid you fly; the Duke has information against
you which must spell ruin for you&mdash;ruin and death.'</p>

<p>'You are mad,' she said quietly.</p>

<p>'No; I am not mad, unless compassion is madness.'</p>

<p>She drew off her mask, and, in the clear white moonlight,
turned her face upon him&mdash;that strange, haunting face of hers,
which Eberhard Ludwig said no man could forget.</p>

<p>'And so you had compassion because you saw me?' she
laughed. 'Your mission is absurd, but I forgive you because
some generous thought was yours even for the Gr&auml;venitzin.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins>
She was all woman at that moment; the hard, cruel oppressor,
the ruling Landhofmeisterin, was banished from her being, she
was fascination incarnate.</p>

<p>'How beautiful you are&mdash;how beautiful&mdash;&mdash;!' the black
mask whispered.</p>

<p>'Tell me who you are,' she said, and smiled at him.</p>

<p>'An enemy who would turn friend, and more&mdash;if he looked
too long at you,' he answered slowly.</p>

<p>'Tell me your name,' she asked once more.</p>

<p>'No; my name you will never know, only I have warned
you.'</p>

<p>'I thank you,' she said gravely, and gave him her hand.
He bent and kissed it, and vanished into the shadow of
the garden. She stood a moment looking after her unknown
visitor. Ruin and death, he had said. She pondered on
why this stranger should have warned her. Evidently an
enemy with an evil plan against her, turned aside by some
man's whim, some sudden mood caused by the sight of her
beauty. Flight, he counselled, flight for her! No! she
would battle to the last, but she would not neglect the unknown's
warning. In a flash it came to her that this man
was connected with the letter which the Duke had refused to
communicate to her. She replaced her mask and returned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
the ballroom. Still the same monotonous whirling crowd,
the pattering feet of the dancers, the din of the music.</p>

<p>She searched for Serenissimus. He was standing with a
group of masks at the lower end of the hall, and did not
observe her. She made her way slowly through the crowd to
the other side of the room, and slipped through the door into
the ante-hall. Immediately two lackeys sprang forward to
inquire her Excellency's pleasure. She waved them away and
passed onward, out to the terrace, and towards her pavilion.
The sentry at her door saluted her, but she gained her own
ante-hall without meeting any of her waiting men, even Maria
was gaping in the crowd in the courtyard probably.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine paused a moment in her antechamber on
the first floor. She listened attentively, and called Maria
under her breath, but no answer came. Then she drew
out the little key, approached the door leading to the
statue gallery and opened it gently. The gallery was in
darkness, save where a faint white radiance was reflected
from the moonlit garden without, but that side of the
palace lay in deep shadow. She crept on and groped for the
lock beneath the plaster Amorino's hand. At first she could
not find it, but after some moments she felt the tiny keyhole,
and, fitting the key, she turned it and the door swung open.
She glided in behind the arras, and found the spring which
opened the partition. She listened; there was no sound
from the room within. She pressed the spring, the tapestry
door opened silently beneath her touch, and she passed into
the Duke's writing-closet. Here the moon shone full in,
white and ghostly. Wilhelmine's mind flew back to that
far-off night at G&uuml;strow, when in the moonlight she had
stolen the key from under her mother's pillow. How she had
trembled! She had been a child in experience then, a very
different being from the strong, self-confident woman she
knew herself to be nowadays. And yet she trembled in the
moonlit room as she had trembled then. What was that?
The moonlight falling in sheeny silver through the window,
seemed to her to take the shape of a tall, white woman's
figure. She remembered the grim old legend of that Countess
of Orlam&uuml;nde, murderess of little children, who haunted all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span>
the palaces of her descendants. In the castle at Stuttgart,
they said, the White Lady walked, her pale trailing garments
streaked with blood. Could she wander here too in new,
gorgeous Ludwigsburg? Almost Wilhelmine turned and fled,
but the remembrance of her dire peril came to her. She
looked bravely at the moonlight&mdash;there was no ghost there;
it was only the Lady Moon, witch of the night, throwing
her cold, false smiles through the casement. Wilhelmine
went forward boldly. She must find the letter at any cost;
its contents threatened her, and she must know.</p>

<p>The Duke's bureau was locked. She pressed the secret spring
in vain. Was she doomed to be baffled, after all? She
remembered that her own bureau was identical with his
Highness's. Resolutely, with that patience which is born
of hazardous undertakings, she glided away through the arras
door, through the black gallery, and regained her apartments.
She heard a movement in her sleeping-room, and Maria came
to her.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency, pray forgive that I was not here.'</p>

<p>Even Maria must not know why she had left the ballroom,
she thought.</p>

<p>'Go to Madame de Ruth's apartments. A black silk domino
lies in the wardrobe; go, bring it to me. I would change my
colour and play a merry jest upon some friends.' The maid
departed. Now all was clear for some time, for Madame de
Ruth's apartment lay at the far end of the east wing.
Swiftly she sought the key of her bureau; it was hidden
in a secret drawer beneath the writing-desk. She took it,
and passed through the little door again. Once more she
listened behind the arras; it seemed to her as if something
moved. She paused, then gently reopened the tapestry door
and peered in. The room lay silent, deserted, white and
ghostly as before. She passed in, and fitted her key into the
bureau. The lock yielded and the bureau flew open. Letters,
documents, drawings, plans for hunting excursions&mdash;all the
usual occupants of Eberhard Ludwig's bureau. She could
see enough in the moonlight. Ah! here a creased paper.
She caught it up and examined it. Yes; this must be the
thing she feared&mdash;four large pages filled with cramped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>
characters. She looked more closely. Forstner's writing!
She almost laughed. This, then, was what his Highness
had hidden so scrupulously from her! Thanks to the unknown's
warning, she had come on the track of her most
deadly enemy. Had the black mask not spoken, she might
have forgotten the letter. She closed the bureau carefully and
stepped behind the arras, shutting the tapestry door carefully.
She was now in perfect darkness. She groped along the
wall to find the lock of the gallery door. Great God! what
was that? A movement near her, an icy touch on her hand.
The White Lady's death-grip! and yet better that, she thought,
than any human being's presence; better that than for any
mortal to have seen her rifling the Duke's bureau. She
sought wildly for the lock. At last she found it and slipped
in the key. As the door sprang open something pushed past
her&mdash;a huge, black shape.</p>

<p>'M&eacute;lac!' she called in a strained voice, and the powerful
beast came to her and rubbed his cold nose upon her hand.
Only the wolf-hound, then, who had been sleeping in the
darkness behind the arras. She laughed when she remembered
her ghastly fear of the White Lady's death-grip!</p>

<p>She regained her own room. Maria had not returned from
Madame de Ruth's apartment. She kindled a light from her
steel tinder-casket and set a waxen taper aglow. Then she
began to read Forstner's letter.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, my Prince, and once my friend! Though
it has been your pleasure to discredit me, I cannot rest until
I have let you know the truth. You are being grossly
abused, your noble trust and love made mock of by a
creature too vile for human words to describe. A woman,
who to her other lovers holds you up to scorn and ridicule!
yes, ridicule of your passion, making mock, betraying the
secrets of your bed. Besides, it is she who has the gulden
which you accused me of purloining; she to whom half your
revenues are carried, and you are doled out a paltry sum
which, after all, you spend again upon this creature. You
are weary of her, too; all your Dukedom knows that right
well&mdash;weary of her, and you dare not dismiss her! The
people laugh: your subjects, your friends, strangers, other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>
princes, all Europe laughs. See her! observe her hideous
faults, her foul blemishes of mind and body, her filthy actions!'
Then followed the names of his rival lovers, and a list of the
vast sums she had filched from the ducal treasury. All this set
forth so cleverly, with such apparent proof, that she trembled
as she read. There were official business transactions accurately
quoted and put in such a light as to seem to be robberies.
It was a dangerous letter for her&mdash;half truth, half falsehood,
difficult to unravel, impossible to deny entirely. 'Honour binds
you, you say,' the epistle continued. 'Ah! my Prince! you
have a toy which has turned to a viper in your hand! Throw
it from you! Other princes have done so, and the world has
applauded. Take a fair and noble mistress, one younger,
less rapacious. Consider this woman: already she grows
gross; in a few years' time she will be a mountain of flesh;
her eyes are dimming, her lips are paler, her teeth less white
than they were when she came from her obscure home.'</p>

<p>Wilhelmine, in all the magnificence of her beauty, of her
maturity, read thus far quietly; then, raging, she sprang to
her feet.</p>

<p>'I could have forgiven you some of your insults, Forstner,
but this is too much! By God! by God! you shall suffer!
I swear it by my salvation!'</p>

<p>She read on: details too disgusting, too gross to write down
here, foul accusation upon accusation, hideous blasphemies
against her bodily beauty.</p>

<p>Of a truth, not even a saint could have forgiven the writer
of that letter&mdash;and Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz was no saint.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE BURNING IN EFFIGY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning following the masquerade, his Highness's
Chief Officer of the Secret Service of Wirtemberg craved
audience. The Secret Service had been instituted by Eberhard
Ludwig after the murderous attack upon the Gr&auml;venitz
in Duke Christopher's grotto. In the unquiet state of the
country, rife with discontent and its attendant conspiracies,
such a service was absolutely necessary; but, of course, this
system of espionage was most unpopular, and as the Landhofmeisterin
was credited with the institution of the Secret
Service, the people's fear and hatred of her increased.</p>

<p>The Chief Officer had grave matters to communicate to his
Highness: a plot to murder her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin
had been discovered, and from intercepted papers
it would appear that the conspirators also aimed at the
Duke himself. It seemed that many influential persons
were implicated.</p>

<p>The design was to induce his Highness to abdicate in
favour of the Erbprinz, during whose minority Forstner was
to be Premier, and the Duchess Johanna Elizabetha Regent
of Wirtemberg. This portion of the conspiracy could be
dealt with easily, but the murderous intent upon the Landhofmeisterin
took a more serious aspect, as the Secret Service
agents had procured information which led the Chief Officer
to infer that the would-be assassins were actually in, or near,
Ludwigsburg. It was, however, impossible to arrest every
stranger on mere suspicion, for both Ludwigsburg and Stuttgart
were full of country gentlemen who had been commanded
to appear at the Mask Ball.</p>

<p>At mention of Forstner, his Highness went to his bureau
to seek his erstwhile friend's letter. In vain he searched in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
drawer and secret panel. The letter had vanished. The four
cadets, who stood sentry at the door of the Duke's apartment,
were questioned; they had seen none enter. His Highness's
private waiting-men were examined, and the soldiers of the
guard who stood in the lower antehall. All answered that
no one had passed through. The Chief Officer of the Secret
Service himself had watched the entrance of the Corps de
Logis during the preceding evening.</p>

<p>The Duke searched his bureau once more. He was greatly
disturbed. Open warfare, a hand-to-hand combat, he said,
were child's play to the horror of this lurking enemy, who
evidently had access even to the private bureau. Zollern
was requested to come and speak with the Duke; his advice
was asked.</p>

<p>'Have you mentioned the matter to the Landhofmeisterin?
She is very wise, and may be able to suggest some explanation,'
said Zollern.</p>

<p>No; his Highness had not seen her Excellency. Then
a sudden suspicion came to Eberhard Ludwig. She wished
to see the letter; could she have purloined it?</p>

<p>'Do you know if the Landhofmeisterin left the ballroom
during the last evening?' he asked Zollern.</p>

<p>No; the old Prince had observed her Excellency constantly,
and she had not been absent from the dancing-hall,
save for a few moments which she passed on one of the
balconies in the company of a black domino, whose identity
Monseigneur de Zollern had been unable to ascertain.
Serenissimus dismissed his suspicions with relief. It is pain
to doubt those we love.</p>

<p>Zollern took his leave, and the Duke desired the Secret
Service officer to retire. He would ask her Excellency's
advice in private. The Landhofmeisterin was summoned to
attend his Highness on important business. After some
little delay she arrived. Passing up the grand stairs, she was
ceremoniously ushered into his Highness's presence.</p>

<p>His suspicion, though dismissed, rankled. Serenissimus
greeted her coldly, and informed her of the letter's
disappearance.</p>

<p>'Your Highness refers to a letter which I was not per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>mitted
to peruse? I regret that it should be lost, but you
will remember that you considered it to be unimportant.'</p>

<p>The relationship between the lovers was strained.</p>

<p>'I do not discuss the importance of the document, Madame.
Indeed, the smallest scrap of paper missing from my bureau
would be a grave matter to me, as I should thus ascertain
that some person had access to my private papers.'</p>

<p>The Duke spoke with cold displeasure. He had felt a
pang of jealous suspicion when Zollern informed him of
Wilhelmine's interview with the black domino; also, he was
still angry with his mistress for her stormy exit after his
refusal to show her Forstner's letter; and further, he was
greatly incensed at the plot to force him to abdicate. All
these causes wrought an iron firmness into his usually gentle
voice. Wilhelmine felt this to be a crucial moment in
her life.</p>

<p>'It would appear that your Highness sees fit to question
me in a strange manner upon this trivial matter! I am not
aware that the Landhofmeisterin's office is concerned with
the superintendence of your Highness's private bureau,' she
said haughtily.</p>

<p>'You know my meaning perfectly, Wilhelmine,' the Duke
broke out furiously. 'Alas! like a pack of cards built in
a card-house, my happiness, my pride, my triumph, my joy in
my new palace, come falling about my head! How sad, how
futile a thing is earthly joy!' He turned away, and bent to
stroke M&eacute;lac's head. The good beast had approached in
seeming anxiety upon hearing the Duke's distressed voice.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine looked at his Highness for a moment in
silence, and her face softened. After all, she loved Eberhard
Ludwig, and in spite of her overweening prosperity,
coupled with the world-hardness which marred her, there
lingered something of tenderness in her love. Then, too,
she was a consummate actress, and a being gifted with
the womanly genius for charming, and therein lies sympathy.
It is when this sympathetic spark is killed by the terrible
blight of over-prosperity, that the deterioration of a woman
takes place. Not all in a day, but gradually, the poison
works: the first stage signalised by a cruel hardness to those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[<a href="./images/245.png">245</a>]</span>
they love; then an entire incapacity for tenderness;
ultimately the hideous blight falls on the woman's charm,
her voice, her face, her laugh, the essence of her being. God
knows the tragedy of it; God alone can gauge the agony
inflicted by the world-hardened women upon the hearts of
those who love them; and God Himself punishes eventually, for:
'The mills of God grind slow, but they grind exceeding sure.'</p>

<p>Still in Wilhelmine there lingered a little tenderness for
Eberhard Ludwig, and this taught her a surer way to her
own safety than ever her brain could have shown her. She
came to him and, laying her hand on his shoulder, she said:
'The world and my heart lie at your feet, Eberhard,
beloved. You are fighting with some wild phantasy, some
spectre which exists only in your own mind. See, we share
all things, let me share your sorrow. Is it only the loss
of this letter which distresses you? Oh! tell me; surely you
will not shut me out from your life?'</p>

<p>Her voice charmed him as on that first day when he had
called her Philom&egrave;le, and he turned to her with his love
shining in his eyes.</p>

<p>'Am I, indeed, scaring myself with a phantom?' he said,
and a note of almost childlike appeal lay in his tone.</p>

<p>'Yes, only that,' she made answer, and, smiling, drew him
to her. Then he told her the story of the plot against them,
but he did not mention Forstner as the prime conspirator.
She laughed.</p>

<p>'<i>You</i> are safe, for none can make you abdicate against
your will; and I am safe because you protect me, beloved.'</p>

<p>'Safe? Yes; but ah! the letter! Who slinks past our
guards and robs my bureau? It is hateful. I love to fight
a man, but this lurking danger which I guess hidden behind
each arras&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The letter? Are you sure you sought in each hiding-place
of your bureau?' she said. Already in her mind a plan was
forming whereby she could allay his fears and conquer his
suspicions. Forstner's letter lay hidden in her bosom; she
would replace it in the bureau-drawer while they searched,
then, with the Duke's knowledge of Forstner's plot, she would
break this dangerous enemy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
'Forgive me, Eberhard, but so many people search frantically
and thus overlook the very object they seek! See, let
us look through the papers together.'</p>

<p>She approached the bureau, and made believe to be mighty
awkward with the fastening. His Highness unlocked the
panel, and together they began a review of the tumbled
documents within, Wilhelmine talking gaily the while.</p>

<p>'What is it like, this precious letter?&mdash;large? small?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'A large paper in Forstner's writing,' returned the Duke,
forgetting that she did not know whence came the letter.</p>

<p>'In Forstner's writing!' she exclaimed. 'And this you hide
from me? The man is my deadly enemy, and, as you know
now at last, but a false friend to you! You say the world is
dark and evil to you; what is it to me when you, the love of
my life, can harbour letters from my cruel enemy?'</p>

<p>She flung herself down on the chair beside the bureau, and
burying her face in the papers on the writing-desk, burst into
a flood of tears. Eberhard Ludwig fell on his knees at her
feet, and in broken words implored her pardon. He kissed
the hem of her garment, accused himself of treason to her,
prayed her to be consoled.</p>

<p>'Give me water, I am faint!' she moaned. He sprang up
and hastened to his sleeping-room to bring water for her.
Now was her moment: with incredible swiftness she drew
the letter from its hiding-place and slipped it under a bundle
of papers and plans on the bureau. When his Highness
returned carrying a goblet of water, he found his mistress
still weeping bitterly with her face hidden on the writing-desk.</p>

<p>She drank the water while Eberhard Ludwig hung over her
in anxious rapture, heaping reproaches upon himself for his
cruelty, but she refused to be consoled.</p>

<p>'What can I do to prove to you that all my unworthy
suspicions have vanished?' he cried in desperation.</p>

<p>'Tell me what was written in that letter; let me defend
myself,' she answered quickly.</p>

<p>'You ask the one thing I may not do. I cannot,' he said
sadly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[<a href="./images/247.png">247</a>]</span>
'And the letter is lost!' she cried; 'who knows what
enemy of mine has got it? Alas! perhaps all the world will
know the vile things this man has written, and you have let
him go unpunished. All will know save the accused criminal!
Oh! the injustice! the cruelty!'</p>

<p>The Duke shuddered.</p>

<p>'Yes, it is true; that terrible thing I had not remembered.
O God! if I could but find that accursed letter! At least,
no one but myself need have known of the foul accusations;
but now that the letter is lost&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Wildly he began to search once more in the bureau, and
Wilhelmine almost laughed when she saw him lift the packet
of papers under which she had slipped Forstner's letter.
With a cry the Duke turned to her.</p>

<p>'Thank God! I have found it! It lay here beneath this
bundle. Wilhelmine, beloved, now none can read these
blasphemies against you,' he cried.</p>

<p>'So you tell me to my face that yonder paper is a blasphemy
against me, a foul accusation, and you will not let me
clear myself!' she cried wildly.</p>

<p>'I swore to Forstner that I would never, in spoken or
written word, divulge his communications&mdash;never give or
voluntarily let another take his letters. Unless you can
divine what you wish to know, there is no help.' He laughed
harshly.</p>

<p>'Divine what is in that letter?' she said in a musing
tone.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought came to her. She remembered each
word of that horrible letter. It was necessary his Highness
should know she knew, yet imperative that her knowledge
should appear to have been gained in his presence.</p>

<p>Wilhelmine had studied many books of magic and
innumerable accounts of occult manifestations. She was
half-dupe, half-charlatan, and indeed she possessed much
magnetic power.</p>

<p>Now in Bavaria, some years before this scene at Ludwigsburg,
there had been discovered an extraordinary peasant-girl
gifted with rare faculties of clairvoyance, thought-reading,
ecstatic trances, prophecies, and the rest. An account of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[<a href="./images/248.png">248</a>]</span>
short twenty years of vision-tortured life had been published
by the doctor of her village&mdash;a crank, and supposed wizard
himself. This pamphlet Wilhelmine had read, as she read all
books concerning mysterious manifestations. His Highness,
however, would never look at anything treating of magic or
witchcraft. He honestly disapproved of such things, and
feared them; though, in contradiction, he was much attracted
by his mistress's strange powers, which he affected to doubt,
yet, in truth, he was terribly afraid at times.</p>

<p>It was certain that he knew nothing of the Seer of
Altbach, and thus Wilhelmine felt assured she might risk
the shamming of one of the peasant-girl's feats, palming it
off as an original accomplishment.</p>

<p>She continued to implore the Duke to show her the letter,
but he was obdurate; honour bound him, he said.</p>

<p>At length Wilhelmine's scheme had matured in her fertile
brain, and she was ready to begin her daring comedy.</p>

<p>'I cannot rest while I am ignorant of the accusations in
that letter. There must be something terrible, some fearful
wickedness against me, which you will not tell me, but which,
like poison thrown into a well, will pollute each thought of
me in your mind, till at length your love of me and your
trust will die. Whereas, if I know of what I am accused, I
can wrench out this poisonous root with the sword of Truth,
for oh! love of mine, I am innocent, save for the sin of loving
you.'</p>

<p>'And yet honour closes my lips! I swore to Forstner that
his letters to me should never be divulged; and though he is
doubtless a traitor to me, still I cannot absolve myself of my
oath,' he answered sadly.</p>

<p>She stood up, and holding out both hands towards him, she
said solemnly:</p>

<p>'Take both my hands in one of yours, look in my eyes,
hold the letter on my brow, and I will tell you what he says.
Thus your honour is cleared, for you have neither spoken
nor given me the writing, but I shall have guessed.'</p>

<p>'What madness is this?' he cried angrily; 'your witch-working
again! But if it calms you to play like this, I am
ready to humour so ridiculous a whimsey.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[<a href="./images/249.png">249</a>]</span>
Half-laughing, half-annoyed, he took the letter from his
pocket. Wilhelmine laid her two hands in one of his and
gazed into his eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood as though hesitating, and the
Duke felt her hands flutter like caught birds. Her eyes
seemed to look into some far distance. Slowly she began in
a low voice:</p>

<p>'Monseigneur, my Prince, and once my friend, you are
being grossly abused, your noble trust and love is made mock
of by a creature too vile for human words. A woman, who to
her other lovers holds you up to scorn and ridicule&mdash;yes,
ridicule of your passion.' Her voice grew faint and faded
into a whisper, and the hands which the Duke held trembled
and twitched violently. Slowly, falteringly, she went on,
sometimes reciting a whole sentence in the very words of
the letter, sometimes only giving the gist; but always in the
same low, monotonous voice, like the utterance of one who
speaks in sleep.</p>

<p>The Duke stood rigid, fear and amazement written on his
face. Once his hand, which held the letter to her brow,
dropped to his side. Immediately the subtle comedian
paused, moaning as though in physical pain. It was a
magnificent bit of trickery; small marvel that his Highness
was deceived.</p>

<p>When she had told him all the paper contained, she
covered her face with her hands and fell to trembling as in
an ague, moaning and sighing incessantly. In truth, she had
worked herself into a fit of frantic emotion, and had her
will been less strong, she must indeed have raved off into
hysterics.</p>

<p>Now consider this thing. Here is a man who had lost
a letter; who sought it; at length finding it safe in a locked
bureau. The search takes place in the very presence of a
being he had half accused of purloining the missing letter.
This person, he is assured by a prince of the highest honour,
has never left a crowded ballroom during the only hours when
it would have been possible for her to have stolen the
paper. Then he himself proposes, in jest, that she should
guess the contents of a document, which he feels certain has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>
been read by himself alone, and has merely been mislaid in a
carefully locked bureau. This extraordinary feat she accomplishes
in a seeming trance. Add to all this, that the woman
is his beloved mistress, whom he ardently wishes to trust, and
that often before she had told him she was gifted with occult
powers. Is it matter of surprise that he implicitly believed
Wilhelmine had accomplished a magic feat? White magic
though; nothing evil here; on the contrary, almost a
miracle, like some medi&aelig;val ordeal through which her purity
and innocence alone could have sustained her. Yet he
questioned her.</p>

<p>Could she read any paper in that manner? She answered
that she had never tried before. She spoke to him in gentle
words, praying him to give good faith to her. She clung
to him like a tired child. What man could resist her?</p>

<p>Then she talked of Forstner's conspiracy. She depicted
the vileness of one who could write such a letter at the
very hour when he was plotting to ruin the man to whom
he penned words of passionate exhortation and affection. She
laid stress upon the treason against Eberhard Ludwig, and he
in return flamed into anger concerning the design to murder
this clinging, appealing woman. Chivalry, honour, duty,
bound him to protect her. Very subtly she led him on: to
protect in this case must be to revenge her.</p>

<p>Then she lashed him to a fury against the traitor who had
plotted against so lenient a prince. Taking the letter from
his Highness (he let her have it now without demur), she
went through the list of accusations, refuting each statement,
throwing the blame upon Forstner for the various monetary
defections which he himself, in this letter, had proved to exist
in the Ludwigsburg building accounts. She pointed out that
Forstner should be punished heavily, both in just revenge and
as a warning to others. At last Eberhard Ludwig yielded,
and promised that she should dictate Forstner's sentence.</p>

<hr />

<p>Forstner tarried at Strassburg. He believed his letter
would awaken the Duke from his long, evil, delicious dream;
but when days, weeks, months passed without any change
taking place at Ludwigsburg, and the Landhofmeisterin's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[<a href="./images/251.png">251</a>]</span>
triumph continued, Forstner's hopes waned. He dared not
return to Wirtemberg, yet the care of his properties demanded
his presence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Eberhard Ludwig had permitted the Landhofmeisterin
to work her will in the Forstner affair. Little
guessed the poor fool, waiting at Strassburg, what a terrible
net was being woven round him. Slowly, silently, with
deadly patience, the Landhofmeisterin was collecting a
thousand threads for this fabric. Documents, statements,
even the accounts of Forstner's private monies were bribed
from his estate agents; each letter that he wrote, everything,
was gathered by the Secret Service and brought to the
Landhofmeisterin's office, where the long chain of evidence
was being linked together by the Gr&auml;venitz and Sch&uuml;tz. She
intended Forstner to be condemned, not only by the Duke's
orders, but publicly, and on a charge so damning as to
alienate all from him. Incidentally, the Duchess Johanna
Elizabetha would be deeply implicated.</p>

<p>In the January of 1712 Forstner at Strassburg received
some warning, and fled to Paris. Here, at least, he believed
himself safe from the machinations of the all-powerful
Gr&auml;venitz. True, he was implicated in that feeble plot to
murder her, which had failed because the young man he had
hired to do the deed had unaccountably disappeared, his
fellow-conspirators having never seen or heard of him since
the night of the Ludwigsburg masquerade. Forstner often
wondered whether the youth was imprisoned in one of
Wirtemberg's grim fortresses&mdash;Hohenasperg, Hohen-Urach,
or Hohen-Neuffen. He shuddered when he remembered how
men vanished into the gloom of these strongholds, which are
built into the rock of the steep hills, and are inaccessible as
an eagle's eyrie.</p>

<p>Yet proof was wanting to convict him of contriving murder
or political disturbance, and, at least, he was safe in Paris.
Lulled into carelessness by the silence from Wirtemberg, he
showed himself abroad, even attending the genial, informal
receptions of the Duchesse d'Orl&eacute;ans, that Princess of
Bavaria who had succeeded, and by her sturdy, uncompromising
treatment of the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, had revenged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
poor Henriette of England, his beautiful, brilliant, but little
appreciated first wife.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Charlotte received Forstner with much condescension.
Death had relieved her, in 1702, from her sickly,
despicable spouse, and she was free to open her house to every
German traveller, which, in his lifetime, Monsieur had always
endeavoured to prevent.</p>

<p>One day when Forstner was journeying to visit the
Duchesse d'Orl&eacute;ans, he was arrested in the King's name and
conveyed to the Bastille, where he was informed that he was
accused of treason to the Duke of Wirtemberg, and of intent
to murder several great personages of his Highness's court.
He was further informed that he would be sent to Stuttgart
under escort as soon as the necessary arrangements could
be completed.</p>

<p>In vain Forstner remonstrated that he could not be imprisoned
in France for a political offence in Wirtemberg. In
vain he protested and claimed the protection of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>
The King at Versailles was busied with the saving of his soul
and with the doctoring of his gangrened knee. So the doors
of the Bastille closed on Baron Forstner, and he was left to
reflect upon the danger of casting aspersions on a woman's
beauty.</p>

<p>After some months the rumour of Forstner's imprisonment
reached the Duchesse d'Orl&eacute;ans, who had believed her compatriot
returned to Germany. Now it was a ticklish thing
for the Duchess to undertake intervention on behalf of a Protestant,
for though she had joined the Church of Rome on her
marriage to 'Monsieur,' still it was whispered in Paris that
she had reprehensible leanings to the faith of her childhood.</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon and the King were more than ever
hostile towards heretics, and the Bavarian princess had received
several sharp reproofs on the subject already.</p>

<p>Then came the news that Forstner had been condemned to
death in Stuttgart, and that he was to be conveyed thither
without delay.</p>

<p>The Duchesse d'Orl&eacute;ans journeyed to Versailles, and demanded
an audience of her august brother-in-law. The King was in an
ungracious mood. He received his late brother's wife coldly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>
He regretted that she should espouse the cause of this foreigner.
Really, he had no intention of interfering in the affairs of any
petty German prince. This was merely a question of international
law. If this 'Baron de Forstn&egrave;re' were in the Bastille,
let him stay there. Louis asked angrily if he were expected
to interest himself in such unimportant details, when he was
so profoundly troubled with affairs of State. Little wonder
that the King was not in a favour-granting humour. The
Congress of Utrecht was discussing peace, and Louis saw that
though he had actually gained the day in the Spanish Succession
War, still France had lost hugely in blood and gold, and
was to lose still more in colonies.</p>

<p>But Elizabeth Charlotte was not to be put off thus easily.
If it came to hard words, no one was more competent than she
was to utter truth unshrinkingly. Petty German princes
indeed! Louis had been anxious enough to share in the
inheritance from a petty German prince, when, at the death of
her father without male heirs, the Roi Soleil had seen a chance
of grasping a portion of the Bavarian Palatinate! And so she
told him in her loud voice and uncouth French. Madame de
Maintenon interposed: Why did her Royal Highness take so
deep an interest in this 'Forstn&egrave;re?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Because he is a Bavarian, and his father and mine were
friends,' she was told by the Duchess.</p>

<p>'Ah! a Bavarian&mdash;then a Catholique?' the saintly Marquise
supposed.</p>

<p>'No indeed!'</p>

<p>Things looked very black for Forstner. But the Duchesse
d'Orl&eacute;ans played her trump card. Though a Protestant,
Forstner was a virtuous man, and the reason of his disgrace
in Wirtemberg was simply that he opposed the terrible licence
of the Duke's mistress.</p>

<p>Now the Marquise de Maintenon was a little sensitive on
the subject of mistresses, and when Elizabeth Charlotte invoked
her aid against the machinations of a wanton, old Veuve
Scarron changed her tone. Then in the midst of the discussion
the King had a twinge in his gangrened knee, and signed
Forstner's release, in order to be rid of this pertinacious
princess.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
Meanwhile there had been storms at Ludwigsburg. In
December 1711 the new Emperor Charles <span class="smcap">vi.</span>, former pretender
to the Spanish throne, was crowned Emperor at Frankfort.
The reigning princes of the various allied German states
attended the coronation of the German king, crowned
Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Eberhard Ludwig of
Wirtemberg repaired to Frankfort for the historic ceremony,
and it was the right of the Duchess of Wirtemberg to attend,
if she so desired; but Johanna Elizabetha remained in her
dreary black-hung apartments, sewing coarse linen garments
for the poor, and weeping her desolation. Pageants were not
for her obviously.</p>

<p>But the Landhofmeisterin demanded to go to Frankfort
with her Duke. Zollern and Madame de Ruth advised her to
refrain from so preposterous a request; but she had set her
mind upon it, and she importuned Serenissimus, who, poor
man, was indeed all unable to grant her this whim.</p>

<p>There were pleadings, tears, angry words, finally a serious
quarrel between the lovers. Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz, now a Privy
Councillor and Minister of State, remonstrated pompously
with his sister. He had gained nearly all he desired through
her, and now affected to be the serious official, the hard-working
minister and grave man of the world. She bade him
return to his petty businesses of administration, and warned
him that, did he interfere with her, she would cause him to be
dismissed. Friedrich aimed at being Premier of Wirtemberg,
and thus he bowed down once more to the all-powerful lady.
The Landhofmeisterin continued to pester the Duke to convey
her to Frankfort. Then, in the midst of this quarrel, news
came from Stetten that the Duchess-mother was sick unto
death, and Serenissimus abruptly left Ludwigsburg to receive
his mother's dying blessing.</p>

<p>He returned in a few days deeply saddened. He had
arrived at his mother's deathbed too late; she had almost
passed away. True, her wan face had lit with love when
Eberhard Ludwig stood beside her; bending over her, he had
heard her murmur once more her favourite catchword, 'My
absurd boy,' then a faint whisper of 'Johanna Elizabetha,' and
the Duke knew that, with her last breath, the honest old lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[<a href="./images/255.png">255</a>]</span>
had called him back to duty. But he returned to weep his
mother's loss upon the breast of Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins>
In this softened mood, his Highness went near the granting
his beloved's prayer, but Zollern stepped in and spoke privately
with the Landhofmeisterin.</p>

<p>Directly after the Duchess-mother's obsequies the Duke rode
northwards to Frankfort to attend the Emperor's coronation.
He journeyed with his chief officers and guards, and his proud
mistress was left behind in Wirtemberg. Yet she had gained
another triumph. If the Duke could not grant her request
concerning the coronation, what would he give her in compensation?</p>

<p>'Anything in the world you ask,' he had replied. And she had
demanded Stetten, the Duchess-mother's dower-house! Zollern
and Madame de Ruth were overwhelmed when they heard of
it. Good heavens! what would the Duchess-mother have
said? But on the day when Eberhard Ludwig rode to the
coronation, the Landhofmeisterin's coach thundered through
the fields to Stetten.</p>

<hr />

<p>When the news came from Paris that Forstner had been
released from the Bastille, the Landhofmeisterin flew into a
towering passion. The Geheimr&auml;the were summoned, and
the affair put before them once more. The evidence against
Forstner was convincing, and any Chamber would have convicted
him; but it is necessary to consider who composed this
Privy Council.</p>

<p>Landhofmeister Count W&uuml;rben&mdash;an invalid unfortunately,
and unable to appear&mdash;was Premier and Minister of War, and
in his regrettable absence his wife, her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin,
presided at the sessions of the Council, and a
more energetic, autocratic President could not have been found
in Europe. Friedrich, Count von Gr&auml;venitz, was Minister of
the Interior; Baron Sch&uuml;tz, Minister for Foreign Affairs;
Baron Sittmann, Minister of Finance; and two brothers Pfau,
cousins of Sch&uuml;tz, held office as Councillors. For appearance
sake (not that the Landhofmeisterin considered that often)
there were several minor councillors, men of no importance,
who obeyed implicitly the autocratic, vigilant, relentless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[<a href="./images/256.png">256</a>]</span>
President of Council. Thus the entire government lay in the
Gr&auml;venitz's capable hands. Small wonder that Forstner
trembled.</p>

<p>The Council decreed that the recalcitrant Baron was to be
summoned to attend his trial forthwith, and that a hope of
rehabilitation should be held out to him if he came immediately
to his country's first tribunal. The death sentence was
rescinded, of course, pending this new trial.</p>

<p>Forstner replied to this official document that he had no
intention of putting his head between the wolf's teeth, and
that he intended to appeal in Vienna against the wrongful
detention of his monies and properties in Wirtemberg. He
reminded the honourable Council that he was by birth a
Bavarian, and that, though he had resided in Wirtemberg, and
owned lands in that dukedom, still the Wirtemberg tribunal
had no jurisdiction over him.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of this answer the Privy Council solemnly
recondemned Forstner to death, confiscated his Wirtemberg
properties, and further decreed that if he refused to be executed
in person, he should be burned in effigy in the market-place
of Stuttgart by the common hangman.</p>

<p>Forstner's response to this was a letter to the Landhofmeisterin,
wherein he suggested that he should summon a
Privy Council on his estates in Alsace, composed of his valet,
his gardener, his lackey, and the village fiddler. That he proposed,
as President of this Council, to condemn her to death;
and should she not joyfully repair for her execution, he would
have her hanged in effigy, head downwards, over the pig-stye.
Probably that drastic Bavarian, the Duchesse d'Orl&eacute;ans, inspired
this letter, or else Forstner had developed a grim wit in his day
of trouble.</p>

<p>The Duke and the Landhofmeisterin raged, and the day of
the burning in effigy was fixed.</p>

<p>Then the officer of the Secret Service came to Ludwigsburg
carrying a bundle of placards torn from the house walls in
Stuttgart. Hundreds of these writings had been nailed to the
walls and the doors, and seemed to resprout there like magic
mushrooms, for as fast as the agent and his men removed one,
another appeared in its place. These handbills set forth the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[<a href="./images/257.png">257</a>]</span>
gist of Forstner's letter to the Landhofmeisterin, but in even
more pregnant terms, and with additional remarks concerning
her person, habits, and transactions.</p>

<p>'Death to the person found affixing such a placard. Imprisonment
to those who speak of these handbills. Fines to
each householder upon whose house or door such a paper is
found.' Thus Eberhard Ludwig decreed; and one miserable
wretch was actually hung for nailing up one of Forstner's
placards; while innumerable fines were imposed upon the
burghers whose houses had been thus decorated.</p>

<p>The burning in effigy of Baron Forstner was fixed for the
15th of February. The arrangements for this strange function
were elaborate, and entirely supervised and in part designed
by the Landhofmeisterin. Her aim was to make this mock
execution not merely a symbol of the criminal's degradation,
but a truly awe-inspiring ceremony, calculated to strike terror
into the minds of the onlookers.</p>

<p>She caused every town and village of Wirtemberg to send
their chief men accompanied by their wives (the Landhofmeisterin
knew the power of womanly gossip in a country,
or indeed in any community) to witness the sham holocaust.
The members of the court were commanded to be present,
and the Stuttgart burghers were informed that non-attendants
would be fined.</p>

<p>The 15th of February dawned clear and frosty, and in
spite of the burghers' hatred of the Landhofmeisterin and
all she did, there was a certain amused anticipation in
Stuttgart regarding the strange ceremony which was to take
place.</p>

<p>For days carpenters, joiners, and builders had been at work
in the market-place erecting a huge platform and a giant
gibbet. The well-to-do burghers hired rooms in the houses
looking on to the square. As they dared not refuse to attend,
they desired at least to make this mock execution an occasion
for popular entertainment.</p>

<p>At nine of the clock the bells of all churches in Stuttgart
began to toll for the dead, and the tramp of soldiers proceeding
to the market-place warned the compulsory sightseers
that it was time to repair thither <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'an'">and</ins> they would not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>
crushed in the mob. Many set out in a jocular humour, but
quickly this gaiety changed; there was something inexplicably
sinister in the atmosphere, a menace to freedom, an appalling
sense of relentless tyranny.</p>

<p>Round the market-place the soldiery formed a double line,
and the people soon saw that this mock ceremony was a grim
threat; for the soldiers carried matchlocks, and the whisper
ran round the assemblage that these were primed and loaded,
and that the soldiers had orders to fire if any group of sightseers
indulged in undue hilarity.</p>

<p>The newly erected platform was draped in black, and in
the middle of the market-place stood a circle of stakes round
a large centre pillar. This circle contained a huge pile of
tar-soaked wood.</p>

<p>A brooding stillness fell on the people. The market-place
was densely packed, each window of the surrounding houses
held its complement of men and women. The church bells
still tolled the solemn death tones, otherwise the silence was
unbroken.</p>

<p>At length a flourish of trumpets sounded. The court was
approaching. First came the officers of State and the members
of the nobility, then a detachment of Silver Guards rode up, and
formed into line before the black-draped platform. Another
fanfare of trumpets and the Landhofmeisterin's gilded coach
thundered into the market-place, the mob crushing back to
avoid the flying hoofs of the escort's horses. Several coaches
followed, containing the red-robed privy councillors and richly
bedizened courtiers. Serenissimus sprang from the Landhofmeisterin's
coach and assisted her Excellency to alight. She
took her place beside his Highness in the centre of the platform,
and the privy council and the court gathered round.</p>

<p>Then appeared a file of soldiers and officers, and in their
midst was a rigid figure lashed between two condemned
criminals. One a murderer, particularly odious to the Stuttgart
burghers, for he had stabbed his employer, a well-known
lady, the much-esteemed widow of a popular town councillor.
The other a notorious horse-stealer, whom the law-abiding
Stuttgarters had stoned but a few months past.</p>

<p>The rigid figure was ridiculous enough: the great waxen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>
head sculptured to an unmistakable, though grotesque, likeness
of the well-known features of Baron Forstner; then the long,
emaciated limbs and even the man's noticeably narrow, flat feet
had been reproduced, and they shuffled stiffly along the frost-dried
cobble stones. It was a masterpiece of ridicule, yet there
was something furiously cruel in the whole absurd travesty
of a human being, something terrible in this association in ignominy,
between the stiff, swaying waxen thing and the condemned
criminals. Slowly this strange procession passed through the
crowd, and the three figures&mdash;the two living, and the gruesome,
inanimate parody of life&mdash;were pushed into the circle
of faggots in the centre of the market-place and bound all
three to the tall middle pillar. Then the common hangman, a
huge, heavy-featured Swabian&mdash;a butcher by usual occupation&mdash;stepped
forward and demanded in the accustomed formula:
'If by the will of God and His representatives of law and order
on earth, these miserable men were to be sent to their eternal
punishment?' The chief officer of law made answer that
such was the 'will of Heaven and of the very noble Prince,
our Lord Eberhard Ludwig, Duke and Ruler of Wirtemberg.'
Then a member of the privy council rose, and in solemn tones
read the indictment of Friedrich Haberle, the murderer, and
Johannes Schwan, the horse-stealer, condemned to be burned
at the stake, together with the effigy of the detestable traitor
and purloiner of State monies, Christoph Peter Forstner.</p>

<p>In spite of the threatened penalty, a murmur ran through
the onlookers. They had expected to see a lifeless thing
burned, but could they indeed be forced to witness the burning
of two living men? The execution of a witch was
another thing&mdash;they enjoyed that; but in cold blood to watch
two human beings, not horrible magicians but merely sinners&mdash;to
see these creatures burned along with that ghastly, lifeless,
waxen thing,&mdash;that was awesome! A woman in one of the
windows screamed, a child in the crowd below lifted a wailing
cry. Perhaps the whole thing was inconsistent! What
difference between the holocaust of a witch and that of two
vile criminals? What matter to the dying men that an absurd
image should be burned with them? yet there lay some indescribable
horror in it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[<a href="./images/260.png">260</a>]</span>
The hangman advanced and applied a flaming torch to the
tar-smeared faggots, which began to hiss and splutter in the
still, frosty, winter air.</p>

<p>'Hold!' cried the privy councillor, 'unbind those men!
Friedrich Haberle and Johannes Schwan are reprieved from
death, their sentence is commuted to flogging and banishment.
Beside Christoph Peter Forstner's crimes these men have
hardly transgressed. It is the will of his Highness that
they should go free, in token of his wise mercy and to let
you see how sure is his justice! And against so lenient a
Prince has this odious traitor Forstner conspired! Hangman,
do your work upon his image in symbol of his well-deserved
punishment, from which the unjust protection of a
foreign monarch shields the actual person of this criminal.
But let this symbol of death be ever present in the souls of
all beholders. Such will be the bodily fate of all those who
conspire against his Highness or his Highness's government.'</p>

<p>The flames sprang upwards, licking round the waxen figure
and scorching the arm of one of the criminals who was being
released from the cords that bound him.</p>

<p>Every eye was upon the beauty of the woman seated beside
the Duke Eberhard Ludwig. In abject submission and deadly
hatred they gazed on the face of her who thus threatened
them, for they read her threat against themselves in every
word of the privy councillor's discourse, her menace in each
flame which consumed the waxen figure of her enemy, Baron
Forstner.</p>

<h3>THE SINNER'S PALACE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Forstner's</span> fate worked marvels in the outward behaviour of
the Wirtembergers. The strange scene upon the market-place
lingered in their minds, and the actual loss which
Forstner sustained in confiscated properties, monies, and titles,
made the sober burghers careful even in the private expression
of their hatred of the Landhofmeisterin. They still
spoke of her as the Landverderberin (Land-despoiler), but they
greeted her with reverential demeanour when she thundered
through town or village in her coach.</p>

<p>Of her witchcraft there was no longer any doubt, in all
opinions. Forstner had suffered from a grievous disease, they
had heard, since the witch-woman had practised her horrid
magic upon his effigy. True, Prelate Osiander had spoken
openly of the natural and inevitable effects of such cruel misfortunes
upon a man, already weakly in health, but they
argued that the churchman was obliged to take this view, and
his Reverence's opinions were rejected.</p>

<p>Yet the fierce hatred only smouldered under this calm
and respectful demeanour, and the Landhofmeisterin knew
this right well, for his Highness's Secret Service reported
many things. The vigilance was unceasing; through the
whole country the spies wandered, and many were the fines
they levied for careless words which they called treason.
'Treason to whom, great God!' wailed the wretched people.
'Treason to his Highness's honour,' they were told, and knew
her Excellency, his Highness's mistress, was meant under
this respectable appellation.</p>

<p>There was no denying it: Wirtemberg belonged to the
Gr&auml;venitzin. Eberhard Ludwig was a mere shadow at her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
side, but a loyal shadow which approved, or affected to approve,
her every action.</p>

<p>The doings at Ludwigsburg were always brilliant, often
gay: masques, banquets, music, play-acting, dancing; and even
foreign travellers repaired to the South German court to view
the brilliancies which equalled those of Versailles before the
pious, wanton Maintenon had turned the palace into a house
of prayer-meeting, strangely enough almost Calvinistic in its
gloom.</p>

<p>At Ludwigsburg the months flew by in a whirl of gaiety
and elegant revelry. The groans of an oppressed peasantry,
the curses of an overtaxed burgherdom, could not pierce
through the chorus of merriment. Smaller stars waxed
and waned, favourites of a day disappeared, but the Landhofmeisterin's
power grew greater, and her ambition became each
day more tremendous. She was treated with royal honours,
and the court customs were so arranged that her kin should
take precedency of all.</p>

<p>The news of Count W&uuml;rben's death caused fresh alarms at
Stuttgart, for it was expected that the Countess would again
endeavour to remove Johanna Elizabetha and marry the Duke.
But she had learned her lesson, and now contented herself
with her towering position as ruler and mistress. To such a
personage the minor detail of legal marriage seemed unimportant,
though Madame de Maintenon's example rankled in the
mind of every royal favourite.</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin believed her position to be unassailable,
and if a thought crossed her mind that all this power and
pleasure depended upon the will of a man and a Prince,
that will which is so often better spelled caprice, still she
could not doubt that this one man, one Prince, was constant
and stable. From the force of love, of trust, of habit, and
of fear he would remain hers till death. And after his
Highness's death? For that she was prepared also. 'Gold
is power,' she had said to Monsieur Gabriel long ago at
G&uuml;strow, and she did not forget this precept. She
spent freely and magnificently, but she amassed an
enormous fund in reserve. No year passed without some
beautiful property becoming hers&mdash;broad acres of field and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
forest, entire villages, old and lordly castles. To name but
a few of these: Gochsheim, Welzheim, Brenz, Stetten (the
Duchess-mother's dower-house), Freudenthal, the Castle of
Urach, and the Ch&acirc;teau Joyeux La Favorite. Her treasury
was well filled, for she levied taxes in the Duke's name,
and they flowed into her privy purse: gold heavy with the
curses of a people. Her dream of an empire where she
should hold secret dominion over the wealth and enterprise
of a vast Jewish community had been realised in a modified
fashion. She had caused the stringent laws against the Jews
to be relaxed; they were permitted to worship openly;
a synagogue was erected in Stuttgart, and Jews could
acquire civil rights. At her village of Freudenthal she had
founded a Jewish settlement. Old Frau Hazzim died
there in peace, blessing the name of the friend of Israel.
The Jews, in return, served the Gr&auml;venitz well, and she had
great sums safely awaiting her out of Wirtemberg. All this in
preparation for the death of the man she loved! Yet, after
all, the most loving and perfect wives make these arrangements
if they can: the dower-house filled with linen and
silver, and the jointure; but it will ever be regarded as a
heinous offence for the mistress to provide for herself.
These condemnations of ours are a part of the spontaneous
human judgment, and it would not be entirely human were
it not gloriously inconsistent.</p>

<p>Freudenthal was the place she loved best of all her
possessions, and here she gathered together the most beautiful
objects: pictures, Italian inlaid cabinets, graceful French
furniture, wonderful silken hangings, carved ivories, many
rare books. The gardens were laid out by her own design.
Freudenthal lies sequestered from the world at the edge of
a little valley, and close behind the village rise long, low,
wooded hills&mdash;the Stromberg, dark with fir-trees, whose
sombre tone is relieved by groves of beeches. Below
Freudenthal verdant fields sweep away in soft undulations,
broken here and there by beautiful orchards. The Gr&auml;venitz
knew that an elaborate garden would be a false note in this
rustic serenity, and her Freudenthal garden was designed in
a simple style. She had found there a peasant's orchard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>
with many ancient fruit-trees; these she left untouched,
merely sowing fine grass instead of the corn which waves
beneath the apple- and pear-trees in every Wirtemberg
orchard. The actual garden she planted with bowers of
roses and beautiful flowering borders along broad grass pathways.
The only artificial embellishments were two flights
of stone steps leading to simple fountains with large stone
basins, where the water gurgled and splashed lazily. 'Frisoni,
build the house not in the new style, I pray you,' she had
said, 'some graceful Italian simplicity were better here';
and he built a very pleasant mansion, unturreted, without
tortured elegancies&mdash;a long, low, broad-windowed country
retreat, each proportion perfect, each line harmonious. What
a wealth of flowers bloomed in the Freudenthal garden! How
fragrant were the roses, the lilacs, the jasmine!</p>

<p>Here the Landhofmeisterin was wont to linger if his
Highness were forced to leave her for a few days. Here
she would live a short span of peaceful hours, ambition
banished awhile, affairs of State forgotten. Here she would
sing again the songs she loved so well.</p>

<p>'Let us go to Freudenthal, et chantons les romances d'autrefois,'
she would say to Madame de Ruth and Zollern. Then
his Highness would come riding down the long, straight,
narrow road from Ludwigsburg. He would dismount at the
orchard gate and call to her: 'Wilhelmine! Philom&egrave;le!' and
for an hour the glamour of youth and an echo of the early
days of a great passion would return to them. Sometimes he
would pray her to sing again the melody which she had
sung in the Rothenwald when they had first loved; but alas!
her voice was not the same. The beautiful notes were there,
the consummate art, but the world-hardness had laid its touch
upon her very music. True, Wilhelmine singing was always
a being much more tender, more pure than Wilhelmine
woman of the world, still her voice registered the hardening
of her soul. Zollern said that when she sang 'she
expressed all she was not,' and it was a cruel truth. Sometimes
there rang for an instant an infinite yearning, but it
vanished, and the cold, perfect, artificially passionate utterance
resumed sway.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[<a href="./images/265.png">265</a>]</span>
Now and then Eberhard Ludwig still wandered in the forest.
He would leave the company of hunters, and followed by
faithful old M&eacute;lac, the wolf-hound, he escaped to revel in the
silence and beauty of the beechwood. Often he was terribly
sad in those days. Wilhelmine perplexed him; it was the
hardness in her heart which made him suffer. He winced
when he heard even her glorious voice fraught with this new
soul of harshness. Often he endeavoured to tell her of his
sadness, but she laughed at him.</p>

<p>What more could he crave from her, indeed? She loved
him, she was true to him. Alas! he could not explain that
it was the essence of her love which had changed. She had
no time to be sad, no time therefore to be tender. Poor
Eberhard Ludwig! poor brilliant, successful Wilhelmine! And
yet, who could blame her if she was greatly occupied? She
was chief minister <i>de facto</i> of a country; she was finance
minister of a queen, she was herself queen; she was Master
of the Ceremonies to a court; she was purveyor of amusements
to a great prince; yet she had lost the faculty to
understand that this prince agonised because she was too
occupied to give him tenderness. Passion she gave him, and
brilliant gaiety; she tyrannised, flattered, charmed, cajoled him,
what more could he desire? Only, he dreamed of the
impossible; he dreamed of the love and friendship which
remain, of the roses and kisses which do not fade and lose
their savour. Of course, it was impossible; but from a
dream's non-fulfilment a tragedy was preparing. The tragedy
of satiety and inevitable disappointment.</p>

<hr />

<p>All Wirtemberg was in the Landhofmeisterin's grasp, but
two things disturbed her entire enjoyment of power: the
continued residence of Johanna Elizabetha in Stuttgart, and
the unrelenting disapproval of the Evangelical Church towards
the unholy court of Ludwigsburg.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church, through Zollern, coquetted with the
Landhofmeisterin in the hope of winning Wirtemberg's
allegiance by her influence. But the Protestant community,
headed by Prelate Osiander, was openly hostile. The
Landhofmeisterin, piqued by this, made overtures offering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>
to endow orphanages, schools, and to repair churches; but
though the Church, after the manner of Churches, swallowed
the gold greedily, still it refused to swallow the Landhofmeisterin
so long as she remained in deadly and open sin.</p>

<p>To oust the Duchess was impossible; therefore it was
deemed sufficient that she should be deserted and apparently
forgotten, and surely in time the Church would permit itself
to be mollified, and if cajolery failed, the Gr&auml;venitz dreamed
of using the well-worn threat of Roman conversion. Meanwhile
she was ruler of the land, and she thought it preposterous
that in the State Church services her great name
went unmentioned in the prayers to God for the salvation of
Wirtemberg's ruler. The Duke was induced to intimate to
Osiander his wish that the Landhofmeisterin should be prayed
for when they interceded for himself. Osiander treated this
request with contempt, and returned no answer. Then the
matter rested for two years, and it seemed as though both the
Duke and his mistress had forgotten it.</p>

<p>One day Osiander was summoned to Ludwigsburg. He
could not refuse to obey the ruler of his country, and though
he suspected the summons to be in truth from the Landhofmeisterin,
it was signed and sealed by Eberhard Ludwig. So
the Prelate rode to Ludwigsburg.</p>

<p>It was as he had feared, and he was conducted to her
Excellency's reception room in the Corps de Logis. Bowing
deeply, the page ushered the Prelate into the large apartment
and retired, and Osiander found himself alone in the presence
of the great Landhofmeisterin.</p>

<p>She came forward graciously and greeted the churchman
with a profoundly reverential courtesy. He returned her
salutation coldly and turned away his eyes, for her beauty
was dazzling still, and he feared he might be influenced.</p>

<p>'I think, your Excellency,' he said quietly, 'I think his
Highness the Duke wished to speak with me?'</p>

<p>'Monseigneur Osiander, I have ventured to request your
presence concerning a matter which has been long in my
thoughts,' she said in her most sonorous tones, and with that
smile upon her lips which few could resist; but Osiander
observed her coldly and gravely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
'I pray you be seated,' she continued, and pointed to a
large red-cushioned chair, one which Zollern had brought
from Rome, the typical dignified, high-backed chair of the
Roman Cardinal. To Osiander its very shape was Papistical.</p>

<p>She flung herself down upon a gilt tabouret which stood
near. It was much lower than the Prelate's seat, and he could
not fail to look down into the deep d&eacute;colletage of her bodice.
He moved away a little, while a faint flush rose to his
cheeks.</p>

<p>'I am listening, Excellency,' he said; 'but you will pardon
me if I urge you to be brief, for I have much business to
transact this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Prelate, it is so difficult to be brief with those who do
not comprehend!' She leaned towards him. 'I have ever&mdash;respected
you, Monseigneur.'</p>

<p>The Prelate drew back from her. In his mind he
repeated over and over again, as though the phrase were an
incantation against some evil spirit: 'The Jezebel flatters
me, the Jezebel flatters me,' but man, he could not remain
insensible to the woman who thus appealed to him, though
priest, he abhorred her. All her charm was in her eyes, her
smile; there was a fragrance about her&mdash;an exhilaration.</p>

<p>'Madame, it were better if you respected God's laws,' he said
sternly. His severity seemed to him as a barrier which he
raised between his human weakness and her evil fascination.
She sprang up; actress that she was, she meant to convince
this man by a grand and tragical scene. She knew him to be
too simple, too unsubtle, to detect the art which lent power
and pathos to her words. Besides, she was well in her r&ocirc;le,
it amused her.</p>

<p>'Ah! you priest of God! I appeal to you, not concerning
the necessarily unjust laws of men, but concerning the law of
God and Nature. See, it is no law of God's that I have transgressed.
Remember, I am truly the wife of Serenissimus,
blessed by prayer. My second marriage is nothing&mdash;merely
a political arrangement. And my sin, what is it? I found
a good man dragging out the days of his youth in sadness
beside a woman who could not understand him&mdash;a woman only
his wife in name. I gave my life to him, I am true to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>
The law of man refuses me justice, but God does not, cannot;
and I appeal to you, as God's representative on earth, to give
me my spiritual right: to include me in your prayers.' She
sank back upon the tabouret. The Prelate was astounded.
The question of the Landhofmeisterin's being mentioned in
the public prayers for the head of the State came back to him,
but it was incredible, preposterous. No; this woman surely
sought the grace of God. She was earnest, repentance had
come to her. She desired his prayers. Thus well had
Wilhelmine gauged the Prelate's character, his incapacity for
detecting the play-actress in the passionate, imploring woman.</p>

<p>The pastor of souls was softened immediately by the vision
of rescuing this strayed spirit.</p>

<p>'My daughter,' he said solemnly, 'if you indeed desire my
prayers, I will intercede daily for you. I shall pray that your
heart shall be steadfast, pray for God's pardon for your evil life.
But I ask you to combat temptation with all your strength.
May Christ in His mercy help you.'</p>

<p>The emotion of his great earnestness rendered the good
man's voice tremulous.</p>

<p>'I thank you, you are generous to me.' She reached him
her hand, and he held it gently between both of his. 'But,
Prelate,' she continued, 'is it not written in the Bible that
when two or three are gathered together God will grant their
requests? I would fain have prayer offered for me in church.'</p>

<p>The Prelate started; yet the demand seemed too outrageous.
He could not credit that this sinner wished for a nation's
prayers as though she were, in truth, the Duke's legal
wife. No, no; she was a repentant sinner seeking the grace
of God. Far be it from him, a sinner, to refuse his help.</p>

<p>'You mean, your Excellency, that you wish me to pray
silently for you when the faithful are gathered together?' he
said tentatively.</p>

<p>'No, I do not mean that,' she answered quickly; 'I wish a
prayer to be said aloud for my salvation.'</p>

<p>The Prelate was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>'Surely you do not wish to make public confession of
repentance before the congregation?' he questioned. The
woman seemed mad to desire thus to proclaim her shame,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
and yet he was filled with reverence for the faith which could
prompt so proud a being to humble herself in the eyes of all
men.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur le Pr&eacute;lat Osiander,' she said after a pause,
'I am the Duke's wife before God, and it is my husband his
Highness's command and mine, that my name should be
included in the official prayer for the head of this Dukedom.
I am ruler I would have you know.'</p>

<p>The preposterous demand was made, Osiander could no
longer doubt. It was no repentant sinner with whom he
dealt, but the all-powerful mistress who had but stooped for a
moment to cajole him in the hope of gaining her aim, and
who, finding him uncompromising, had resumed her imperious
habit. The Prelate was aghast, indignant. He rose stiffly
from his chair.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency cannot have considered this command, or
even you, Madame, would not have dared to make it. The
only prayer that can be said for you in church is that of
intercession for the sinful.'</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin approached closely.</p>

<p>'Will you accede to my request? If not, you shall obey
my order or it will be the worse for you.' She was beside
herself with anger. She hated the word Sin; she always said
it represented the bourgeois' criticism of the life of gentlemen.</p>

<p>'No, Excellency, I will not obey you. With my consent
the pure service of the worship of God shall never be sullied
with your name.' Osiander was the sterner, the more relentless,
because of his momentary weakness and credulity.</p>

<p>'You are obliged to pray for me,' she retorted mockingly;
'each time you petition Heaven for the health and happiness
of the Duke, you pray for me! For me, do you hear? I
am his health and his happiness.'</p>

<p>To Osiander this was rank blasphemy, and, good man
though he was, he lost his temper.</p>

<p>'Indeed, Excellency, you say rightly. You are truly included
in the prayers of the congregation, for each time we say
"Lord, deliver us from evil," we pray for the end of your
infamous reign.'</p>

<p>The Gr&auml;venitz laughed harshly. All traces of her softer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>
mood, of her fascination, had gone past; she had become once
more the cold, proud woman, the tyrant whose statue-like
beauty seemed to the Wirtembergers to be some devil's mask
of false outward fairness, covering a mass of inner corruption.</p>

<p>'Is this the only answer you have, Osiander?' she asked
roughly.</p>

<p>'Yes, your Excellency, and if it were to be my last word on
earth.'</p>

<p>The Gr&auml;venitz looked at him fixedly for a moment; after
all, she rather admired his intrepidity.</p>

<p>'Your audience is at an end,' she said haughtily, and bowed
slightly as though she were really some rightful sovereign
dismissing a froward courtier.</p>

<p>The Prelate returned her salute equally slightly, and turning
away with a sigh, he left her presence.</p>

<p>In later years the estimable man was wont to aver he had
never been so near to insulting a woman, yet he would add:</p>

<p>'But she was great in her very wickedness! Surely she
must have been one of the angels fallen from Heaven and
apprenticed in Hell! for of a truth she was in evil as compared
with ordinary sinners, what in holiness is a saint compared
with ordinary good people. A wonderful woman, alas!'</p>

<p>Ah, Osiander, did she leave some clinging fragrance, some
spark of her subtle charm, to tingle for ever through your
pure, simple soul?</p>

<hr />

<p>In 1716 the Erbprinz Friedrich Ludwig had espoused
Henriette Marie of Brandenburg-Schwedt, a pretty and most
correct Princess who possessed, among other graceful talents,
a perfect genius for tasteful dressing. The marriage festivities
had not taken place at Stuttgart, in order to avoid the obvious
complications of the meeting of the bridegroom's parents.
The Erbprinz hardly knew his father, for Eberhard Ludwig
had permitted him to remain chiefly with the Duchess in
Stuttgart. At least the unfortunate Johanna Elizabetha was
granted the happiness of watching over her gentle, sickly son.
The boy had led a dull life enough in deserted Stuttgart, and
his natural aptitude for music and study had thus found free
scope. Immediately after his marriage, however, he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>
commanded to reside at Ludwigsburg, where a fine suite of
apartments was prepared for him and his bride.</p>

<p>Friedrich Ludwig protested that he desired to remain in
Stuttgart, but the Landhofmeisterin willed it otherwise, and
Serenissimus enforced her will.</p>

<p>Henriette Marie played her part in this difficult position
with dignity and well-bred tact. She was perfectly correct
in her demeanour towards the Landhofmeisterin, yet she kept
her at a distance and gently rebutted the mistress's friendly
advances, and refused to notice her subsequent sneers.
Twice during each week the Erbprincessin drove to Stuttgart
to visit her unhappy mother-in-law, and she was careful to
inform Serenissimus of every intended visit. 'Have I your
Highness's permission to journey to Stuttgart?' and 'I thank
your Highness, I shall start this afternoon.'</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin raged, but she was powerless against
the Erbprincessin's quiet dignity and amiable, obstinate coldness.
Then, too, Henriette Marie's wardrobe was a source of
much annoyance to Wilhelmine; she feared the younger woman
had finer gowns than she. In fine, it was the tragi-comedy
of that painful jealousy of the woman approaching forty years
for the youth of twenty summers.</p>

<p>The Erbprinz, however, could not resist the Landhofmeisterin's
charm. She sang him to a very frenzy of delight; she
assumed a tender, motherly anxiety over his delicate health&mdash;an
anxiety which she made charmingly friendly; while she
avoided the tiresome questions, the constant open observation,
the galling reminders of his weakness in the presence of
others, all that which poor, really tender, desperately anxious
Johanna Elizabetha had done, wearying her son, shaming him
with his physical delicacy.</p>

<p>The Erbprincessin bore a son in August 1718&mdash;a weakly
child, the picture of his feeble father. The little life's flame
flickered and shuddered through one bitter Wirtemberg
winter, and in February 1719 passed away into the best sleep
the baby had ever known.</p>

<p>Here again the Landhofmeisterin triumphed over Johanna
Elizabetha. She knew how to console the Erbprinz with
words of hope, how to turn his thoughts away from the empty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
gilded cradle where had lain that frail little being whom
poor Friedrich Ludwig had loved with all his gentle heart.
Alas! Johanna Elizabetha was too sad herself to be able to
cheer sorrow, and she invariably met her stricken son with
floods of tears, doleful questionings, torrents of lamentations,
and he went back to Ludwigsburg&mdash;and the Landhofmeisterin&mdash;for
consolation.</p>

<p>Thus things were fairly smooth at Ludwigsburg, and to
Johanna Elizabetha it seemed like some wonderful, illicit
heaven where her husband revelled and whence she was shut
out. She sometimes dreamed of breaking into this Elysium,
of expelling the regnant devil and rescuing Eberhard Ludwig.
'Perhaps, if your Highness spoke with Serenissimus things
might change,' counselled Madame de Stafforth, and the
Duchess prayed for strength to conquer the fortress of vice,
Ludwigsburg. For years she hesitated. Indeed, she felt it would
be almost immodest to enter the Sinner's Palace, but the day
came when she decided to risk herself in the endeavour to
turn his Highness's heart back to purity&mdash;purity and herself.
She dressed herself in her sombre best and ordered her coach.
Madame de Stafforth volunteered for service, but the Duchess
said she would go alone. She was very brave and terribly
afraid.</p>

<p>Through the waving, yellow corn-fields, bordered by fruit-trees
for the most part, or else lying like a narrow white
riband in the midst of the broad rich valley, the road wound
from Stuttgart to the Erlachhof forest and the palace of
Ludwigsburg. It was early August when the Duchess
journeyed thither, and the corn stood high and golden in the
hazy warmth of the sunshine. Far away to the right the
hills rose blue and veiled, and to the left the grim fortress of
Hohenasperg dominated the smiling, fruitful plain with frowning
menace. Johanna Elizabetha's eyes sought the distant
mound where she knew lay the prison fort; perchance
Serenissimus would answer her pleadings by imprisonment in
that dark fastness.</p>

<p>Her coach lumbered slowly on. The Duchess's horses
were old and little used to work, and the journey seemed
endless. At length the avenue leading to the residence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span>
gates was reached, and in the cool shade of the chestnut-trees
the Duchess's courage returned. After all, it was her right
to enter any Wirtemberg palace, she told herself; yet a chill
foreboding gripped her. Should she turn back?</p>

<p>The coach came to a jolting halt, and she heard her outrider
explaining to the sentry at the gate that she was the
Duchess journeying to the palace. The man seemed doubtful,
but after several minutes' parley the little cort&egrave;ge of two outriders,
an old shabby coach, two troopers of a Wirtemberg
regiment for escort (no Silver Guard here!), and a heart-broken
woman, was allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>The palace of Ludwigsburg lay in the August afternoon haze.
Her Highness's eyes wandered over the vast pile: the long,
low orangery to the south; the numerous rounded roofs of the
palace which seemed like the amassment of a group of giant
red-brown tortoises; the thousand large windows glinting in
the sunshine, the stately gardens. The Duchess sighed
deeply as her coach rolled down the broad street which led
to the palace gates. She saw the fine houses which bordered
this street on one side only, like so many courtiers turning
their smiling faces towards the gardens, the palace, and&mdash;the
Landhofmeisterin.</p>

<p>All this, then, Eberhard Ludwig had raised to honour the
whim of a courtesan, of an unknown adventuress from
Mecklemburg, while she, the Duchess, legal wife, princess of
a noble house&mdash;she was shut out, banished to a grim haunted
castle in a deserted town! She wrung her hands together.
She was helpless, hopeless.</p>

<p>Several courtiers, lingering in the street, stared curiously at
the shabby coach. One of the French dressmakers, hurrying
from the palace, stood stock still in surprise at seeing so
inelegant an equipage in the street of magnificent 'Louisbourg.'
The Duchess, with the morbid sensitiveness of a deeply
wounded, slighted woman, winced under the scornful inspection
of the pert little dressmaker.</p>

<p>Now the coach entered the first gate of the palace, and
once more the outrider was obliged to proclaim and assure
the identity of the carriage's occupant. This time the sentry
flatly refused to believe him, and it was necessary to call the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[<a href="./images/274.png">274</a>]</span>
Captain of the Guard. Here the Duchess's spirit asserted
itself. She summoned the Captain to the door of the coach
and haughtily bid him admit her immediately. But the
Captain, a youth appointed by the Gr&auml;venitz, feared her
Excellency's displeasure more than God or man, and though
he was gentleman enough to treat the Duchess courteously,
he begged her to wait while he repaired to the Landhofmeisterin
for instructions. No one was admitted to the palace
without permission from her Excellency, he said.</p>

<p>The Duchess inquired if Madame de Ruth was in the
castle. At least, she hoped that for the sake of old memories
the grande Ma&icirc;tresse du Palais, 'Dame de D&eacute;shonneur,' as she
had once named her, would have sufficient humanity to help
her now. Madame de Ruth was in the castle, the Captain
replied, but she was very old and infirm, and he feared to
disturb her afternoon rest. Very old and infirm? The
Duchess sighed. Ah! many years had passed since she had
seen the garrulous lady. Alas! she was no longer young
herself. God in heaven! why did that sinful, triumphant
wanton alone retain her beauty? She had been told that the
Landhofmeisterin, like some evil giant tree, seemed to grow
more beautiful, more resplendent each year. It was not
true; for Time had set his cruel fingermarks upon Wilhelmine,
but her wonderful health and her complaisant knowledge of
success gave her a seeming youth. True, the pert little
French dressmaker could have told the Duchess of violent
scenes over gowns made to the measurements of former years,
which could not fit her Excellency; but the courtesan pays a
homage to Venus, offering up the tribute of powder, paint, and
gorgeous clothes, and Venus responds by a gift of seeming
youth; while the virtuous woman is punished for her virtue
and her neglect of the Goddess of Appearance, by a shorter
span of beauty and youth. Yet there is an unerring justice
in the world. When Time has worked his inexorable will,
and powder, paint, and crafty clothing can no longer hide his
ravages, then the virtuous woman triumphs, probably for the
first time in her life. They are both old, she and the
courtesan, but she is sometimes beautiful&mdash;old, grey, and sere,
but venerable, charming&mdash;and little children love her, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>
younger women bring their troubles&mdash;ay, and their joys,
reverently to her, feeling a benediction in the touch of the
pure, withered hand. While the courtesan&mdash;alas! a ridiculous
garish absurdity, a grim ghost of past merriment, a
horrid relic of forgotten debauches, a painted harridan at
whom the boys jeer when she passes down the street. Here
is one of God's great judgments and one of Nature's object-lessons.</p>

<p>But Johanna Elizabetha did not think of all this as she
sat waiting at the gates of Ludwigsburg Palace; her mind was
centred upon the probability of Madame de Ruth's kind
heart prompting her to assist her erstwhile mistress. The
minutes dragged on. Old and infirm, he had said; perhaps
she came slowly down the stairs? Ah! at last! the Duchess
heard the well-remembered voice in the distance talking
ceaselessly. Then she saw Madame de Ruth, leaning
on the arm of the Captain of the Guard, coming slowly
towards her.</p>

<p>A deep courtesy, and Madame de Ruth stood at the coach
door. In a tremulous voice the Duchess informed her that
she would speak with Serenissimus on urgent business, but
that the guard refused her admittance and she had therefore
begged her to come to her assistance.</p>

<p>'Aha! your Highness craves the assistance of a Dame de
D&eacute;shonneur? Nay,' she added in a gentler tone, 'I fear I
have not the power to admit your Highness save to my own
apartments.'</p>

<p>The Duchess bent forward. 'Madame de Ruth,' she said
solemnly, 'you are an old woman and so am I; we have not
many years before God judges us at His Eternal Tribunal. I
pray you, by your hope of His mercy, to have mercy on me,
help me this once.'</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth looked at her; indeed, the Duchess's
tragic face was enough to soften even a harder heart than
beat under the old courtesan's padded, beribboned corsage.</p>

<p>'Well, your Highness, come with me! I will endeavour
to summon Serenissimus to my apartments,' she said. 'It will
not be easy, and I hope your Highness is prepared to offer
me apartments in Stuttgart? I may require them after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[<a href="./images/276.png">276</a>]</span>
this! My friend the Landhofmeisterin is averse to any one
being admitted to the palace without her permission.'</p>

<p>They passed through a maze of long, lofty, pink marble
walled corridors, and up several winding stone stairs, ere they
reached Madame de Ruth's apartments. Here the old
courtesan left her Highness, while she withdrew to make
arrangements for the Duke to be summoned. In truth, she
hastily despatched a billet to the Landhofmeisterin informing
her of the extraordinary occurrence, and begging her for
instructions. Even Madame de Ruth was under the
Gr&auml;venitz's iron rule and dared not offend her. The curt
answer came back written in her Excellency's energetic,
elegant writing: 'How is her Highness's appearance?'
Madame de Ruth replied equally curtly with the one word
'Hideous!' and a moment after the paper was returned to her:
'Let him see her.&mdash;Wilhelmine von W&uuml;rben und von
Gr&auml;venitz, Landhofmeisterin.'</p>

<p>It was a curious interview between Eberhard Ludwig and
his deserted wife; strained, unnatural, terrible, this meeting
after long years, and insensibly they fell into their old
attitudes: he wearied, irritated, coldly courteous; she tearful,
imploring, tiresome. He told her that she was nothing
to him, and that she had no further claims upon him; he
provided residence, appanage, everything to which she had a
right. She responded that she claimed his love, his company,
and in answer he bowed deeply and left her presence.</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth returning to her rooms found a fainting
woman prone upon the floor, and to her credit be it written,
she tended the Duchess gently. When her Highness recovered
from her swoon she requested Madame de Ruth to
lead her to the palace chapel.</p>

<p>'I would fain leave a prayer here! A foolish fancy, you will
say, but the sorrowful are often foolish,' she said bitterly.</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth guided the Duchess through another
maze of long corridors, and ushered her into the tapestried
room which is behind the palace gallery. Her Highness
gazed with displeasure at the luxurious furnishing of the
Ducal pew, its gilded armchairs, red silk cushions, soft red silk
praying hassocks, and the gilt casement looking down into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>
the church. The church itself, designed by the Italian
Papist, Frisoni, showed a wealth of delicate pink brocade and
of rich azure hangings, of golden angels, of smiling goddesses
whose voluptuous faces bore so unmistakable a likeness to the
Landhofmeisterin. With a sigh the Duchess fell on her
knees. 'God is everywhere,' she reminded herself, 'even in
this frivolous chapel.' She prayed earnestly for some time,
and, rising, would have turned to go, when her eye was caught
by a finely sculptured medallion, placed high up to the right
of the much gilded and ornamented pulpit. Its subject was
Truth, and this severe personage stood represented by a
charming shepherdess with rose-wreathed mirror, and flower-bedecked,
coquettish hat, bare breast, and a skirt which, for
no particular reason unless it were the showing of the
model's beautiful limbs, suddenly fell on one side from the
hip to the ankle of this remarkable figure of Truth. Here
again the face was unmistakable, and the sculptor had
taken immense pains to make this medallion a masterly
portrait of the Landhofmeisterin.</p>

<p>With a gesture of despair and disgust the Duchess turned
away and hurried through the corridors. Placing her hand
on Madame de Ruth's arm she pressed her guide forward at
so rapid a pace that the older woman almost fell.</p>

<p>'Quick, Madame! quick, Madame! take me from this
terrible place!' the Duchess repeated. It seemed to her that
Wilhelmine's face, her triumphant beauty, pursued her at
every yard of the Sinner's Palace. Even in the church she
knew that each figure, feigning to beautify the House of God,
was in reality merely another homage to the great mistress,
another subtle compliment of the architect Frisoni's for the
Landhofmeisterin.</p>

<p>Madame de Ruth accompanied her Highness to her coach,
and in broken words the Duchess thanked her. 'If Fate
turns against you here, Madame, you will find a welcome
at Stuttgart in memory of your kindness on this most
miserable day,' she said. But Madame de Ruth shook
her head. She was of the Ludwigsburg world, and when
Frivolity forgot her she knew that she would need no other
refuge than six foot of earth beside her dead child.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>
Wearily the Duchess took her way homeward. There was
no spark of hope left in her heart now; she only raged that
she had humbled herself, and to no avail. The magnificence
of Ludwigsburg smote her as an insult. She shuddered at
the remembrance of the endless reproductions of her enemy's
features: the whole palace was a marble homage to the
Gr&auml;venitz, a beautiful, enduring, kingly homage.</p>

<p>But the palace chapel! Ah! that was the worst of all,
a very blasphemy. And yet how wondrous beautiful it was,
this palace.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, but in the darkness she saw again the
smiling face of the woman who had ruined her life; she saw
the graceful figure in the chapel medallion, the voluptuous
parted lips of the carven angel who held the canopy over the
pulpit, the delicately chiselled features of the Aphrodites and
the nymphs which she had been forced to pass in the palace,
and each one of which bore a resemblance to the Duke's
mistress.</p>

<p>The sun was setting behind Hohenasperg, and a blood-red
glow lingered in the sky over the south-westerly hills of the
Rothwald. The peasants were going homeward after their
day's work; already their sickles had cut great gaping
wounds in the waving, yellow beauty of the corn-fields. A
fresh north breeze sprang up and sent the white dust whirling
in clouds behind the Duchess's coach. And the north wind
brought Johanna Elizabetha another pang, for it wafted to
her a sound of music from Ludwigsburg. The musicians of
the Silver Guards were playing a merry strain in the palace
gardens.</p>

<p>To the forsaken, humiliated woman this moment was symbolic
of her whole life: she journeying alone down the dusty
road towards the gathering gloom over Stuttgart; Eberhard
Ludwig and the Landhofmeisterin at their beautiful palace
living in music and revelry.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE GREAT TRIUMPH AND THE SHADOW</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> years Germany had gossiped over the so-called 'Persian
Court' of Leopold Eberhard of Wirtemberg, Duke of
M&ouml;mpelgard. This prince had been so pampered by his
mother, Anne de Coligny, that he reached the age of twelve
years without having learned to read or write. When the
over-tender mother died, the boy's father, Duke George, took
his dunce-son's education in hand; but this gentleman was
peculiar in his notions of the training of young minds.
French and German he deemed unnecessary trivialities, and
the Christian religion a banality. Instead of these prosaic
lessons the boy was instructed in the Arabic, Hebrew, and
Persian tongues, and, in lieu of the Bible, the Koran was
placed in his hands.</p>

<p>A handsome, reckless, passionate youth, imbued with the
comfortable theories of polygamy, Leopold Eberhard was
destined to succeed his father in the family honours, and
achieve a course of Persian living which, while practised
frequently under other names at many courts, astounded
Germany by this legalised manner of illegality.</p>

<p>One lady was already the wife of Leopold Eberhard. She
was the daughter of a baker, and had held the post of
housemaid at the small court of Oels in Silesia. Having
succeeded in espousing a gentleman of the name of Zedlitz,
she turned her attention to the eighteen-year-old Erbprinz
of M&ouml;mpelgard; and her husband, Herr von Zedlitz, not
approving of this new relationship, she divorced him and
married Leopold. At first this undistinguished alliance displeased
the old Duke of M&ouml;mpelgard, and he endeavoured
to disinherit Leopold Eberhard; but when the ex-housemaid
bore a fine son, the grandfather relented, and the couple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[<a href="./images/280.png">280</a>]</span>
took residence at M&ouml;mpelgard, the lady being created by the
Emperor Countess of Sponeck.</p>

<p>Now, in M&ouml;mpelgard resided an aged captain of the
Imperial army, one Richard Curie, a tailor by trade, who,
having enlisted in the army and risen to the rank of captain,
changed his uneuphonious name to Monsieur l'Esp&eacute;rance,
married a M&ouml;mpelgard butcher's daughter, and settled in her
native town. Four fine daughters were born of this marriage.
Leopold Eberhard cast his eyes upon these beautiful girls and
remembered his Mahometan principles. At this juncture,
Duke George conveniently died, and Leopold Eberhard
became Duke. Immediately all four damsels l'Esp&eacute;rance
were appointed ladies' companions to the Countess of Sponeck.
The eldest, S&eacute;bastiane, was the first object of Leopold's
affection, but the Countess Sponeck suspected the intrigue
and remonstrated with her spouse. To divert her jealousy
from S&eacute;bastiane the Duke paid sham court to the youngest
sister, Polyr&egrave;ne, but the playacting turned reality, and ended
in serious passion. However, this episode with the second of
the l'Esp&eacute;rances soon came to an end, for Polyr&egrave;ne fell dead
during a gavotte at court. Great mourning, and Leopold
sought consolation with another sister l'Esp&eacute;rance, Henriette
Hedwig, wife of a lieutenant in the M&ouml;mpelgard guards,
Herr von Sandersleben. This gentleman objected, divorced
Henriette Hedwig, and left the Duke's service.</p>

<p>The Countess of Sponeck and the two sisters Esp&eacute;rance
resided under one roof. We are told that it was hell on
earth: they fought, they scratched, they yelled, they bit, till
the Duke arrived on the scene, parted the combatants, and
usually thrashed&mdash;the Countess of Sponeck! All Germany
knew, watched, and laughed.</p>

<p>At length it could be borne no longer, and the Countess of
Sponeck, with her children, retired to a distant castle. Then
Henriette Hedwig died, and the M&ouml;mpelgard court seemed
tidied up a little, although Henriette left five children in the
castle, two of whom called Leopold father.</p>

<p>But there still remained a fourth sister Esp&eacute;rance,
Elizabeth Charlotte. This lady's ambition soared higher
than that of the other three sisters. She made Leopold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[<a href="./images/281.png">281</a>]</span>
divorce the Countess of Sponeck. The other sisters had been
called the legal wives of the Duke, according to his Mahometan
principles, but Elizabeth Charlotte insisted upon a greater
surety, and Leopold acquiesced, as usual, when his affections
were engaged. The Countess of Sponeck being divorced, he
married the fourth and last sister Esp&eacute;rance. He spoke of
poor Sponeck as 'The Widowed Lady,' and Elizabeth
Charlotte as 'The Reigning Lady.'</p>

<p>Now came the complications concerning the offspring of
the Duke's various wives. To annoy poor Sponeck, Leopold
in 1715 had entered into a contract with Wirtemberg,
whereby he declared his distant cousin, Eberhard Ludwig, heir
to M&ouml;mpelgard; but he soon repented of this admission, and
besought the Emperor to legitimatise his children: those
morganatically born by the Countess of Sponeck, and the rest
of the brood from the Esp&eacute;rance sisters. The Emperor refused.</p>

<p>Then Leopold appealed to Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>, who also proved
obdurate. Finally during the Regency, Leopold repaired to
Paris in person and prayed the Regent, Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, to
legitimatise his progeny. 'A Lutheran prince was legally permitted
to marry whom, when, and as often as he wished,' he
averred. This precept being received with mockery, he
expatiated on Persian customs, and declared himself a
believer in the Koran alone. But Paris laughed at him, and
after making himself ridiculous at the court of France during
eight months, Leopold returned to M&ouml;mpelgard. Then he
married his son, George Leopold, Count of Sponeck, to his
daughter Eleonore Charlotte of Sandersleben; and his son,
Karl Leopold of Sandersleben, to his daughter Leopoldine
Eberhardine of Sponeck. This double marriage was a magnificent
ceremony at M&ouml;mpelgard, and Duke Leopold was wild
with delight at the revival of 'the beautiful old Persian
custom.' But Germany, and even France, stood aghast at the
horrible affair. To celebrate his four children's nuptials,
Leopold gave a grand ball. In the midst of this festivity he
was struck down with apoplexy. The sisters Esp&eacute;rance,
S&eacute;bastiane and Elizabeth Charlotte, fled before the approach
of death, but honest Sponeck hastened back from her distant
castle, and Leopold died in her arms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>
Eberhard Ludwig of Wirtemberg laid claim to M&ouml;mpelgard,
but he was obliged to send troops to seize his inheritance.
Then the bastards in a body commenced legal proceedings
against the rightful heir, and against each other. Europe
looked on, scandalised and amused.</p>

<p>The eldest Sponeck and his sister-bride hurried to Paris&mdash;'Prince
et Princesse de Montb&eacute;liard,' they styled themselves&mdash;and
as they were young, handsome, and seemingly wealthy,
many persons of note espoused their sorry cause.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig, who now added to his titles that of Duke
of M&ouml;mpelgard, waited patiently for some time ere he took
possession in person of his new domain. His troops were
there, and Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz had been despatched to take
direction of affairs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some of the bastards were raising doleful cries
in Vienna and in Paris, but a few remained obstinately at
M&ouml;mpelgard, and to Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz was assigned the
task of removing them before Serenissimus made his state
entry.</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin had intimated her intention of accompanying
his Highness on this official journey, and there had
ensued a sharp quarrel, by letter, between the lady and her
brother in M&ouml;mpelgard. She won the day, of course, as usual,
yet her heart was heavy in this hour of her greatest triumph,
for the Duke grew colder to her each day. Madame de Ruth,
her wily counsellor, had died a few months after the Duchess
Johanna Elizabetha's visit to Ludwigsburg, and the courtiers
had marvelled at the Landhofmeisterin's passionate grief. She
had followed the old courtesan's coffin to Neuhaus, and had
seen her laid to rest beside the little mound of the child's
grave. And the Gr&auml;venitz had refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>Zollern almost deserted Ludwigsburg after his old mistress's
death. He withdrew to his castle, and only at rare intervals
could he be persuaded to visit the Duke and the Landhofmeisterin.</p>

<p>Yet the Gr&auml;venitz's power was unabated; in point of fact,
it seemed to grow more absolute; but the courtiers noticed
her melancholy, and while some put it down to her grief at
Madame de Ruth's death, others observed the Duke's colder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[<a href="./images/283.png">283</a>]</span>
manner, and predicted the Landhofmeisterin's downfall. It
was a blow to these prophets when the news was confirmed
that the Gr&auml;venitz was to accompany Serenissimus on his
state entry to M&ouml;mpelgard. There were various intrigues to
prevent her Excellency from carrying out the project. Chief
among these was a riot at M&ouml;mpelgard, which was entirely
organised and stirred up by discontented Wirtembergers. It
required little to enflame the M&ouml;mpelgarders, for they hated
the very name of Duke's mistress from past Esp&eacute;rance experiences,
and the Landhofmeisterin's doings in Wirtemberg were
well known.</p>

<p>Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz wrote at great length to his sister
(he always wrote lengthily, and the most trivial letter he
alluded to as 'my business,' saying pompously, 'I have been
working'). So he wrote at enormous length to Wilhelmine,
advising her to refrain from journeying to M&ouml;mpelgard, but
the Landhofmeisterin only laughed, and hurried on the preparations
for the official entry.</p>

<p>Shortly before this time a new body-guard had been
enrolled at Ludwigsburg. It did not oust the famous Silver
Guard from favour, and the Cadets &agrave; Cheval also retained their
proud position, but the new body-guard was a most resplendent
corps, composed entirely of gentlemen of noble birth.
One of Madame de Ruth's last witticisms had been to compare
this 'Chevaliergarde' to the French and Austrian Chanoinesses.</p>

<p>'Really, Monseigneur,' she had told Serenissimus, 'you
should make it compulsory for the gentlemen of the Chevaliergarde
to have sixty-four quarterings and pure morals!'</p>

<p>Of course there was jealousy between the Silver Guard and
the Chevalier troop, and the young Cadets &agrave; Cheval looked
with displeasure at the new guard. But the Landhofmeisterin
settled that as she did all things; she decreed that when the
Cadets reached the age of twenty-one years it should be open
to them to serve in the permanent Chevaliergarde, or to apply
for officers' commissions in the Silver Guard, and the latter
appointments being perforce limited in number, it soon became
the recognised thing for the Cadets who wished to remain in
the military service to enter the Chevaliergarde. The Landhofmeisterin
ruled even the army.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[<a href="./images/284.png">284</a>]</span>
Her Excellency had instituted an Order. His Highness
had his St. Hubertus to give, and she desired to have an
Order of her own to distribute. Everybody laughed covertly,
but the insignia of the Order of the White Trefoil were
much coveted nevertheless, and the white riband and
beautifully designed three-leaved badge of the Gr&auml;venitz's
Order were proudly worn by the highest dignitaries, and
at Ludwigsburg the courtiers who were fortunate enough
to possess the decoration were careful never to appear
without it.</p>

<hr />

<p>On a glowing July morning a splendid cavalcade started
from Ludwigsburg: the Silver Guard, the Cadets &agrave; Cheval,
the Chevaliergarde, the dignitaries of the Wirtemberg court,
and his Highness Eberhard Ludwig riding at the door of the
golden coach, wherein throned the Landhofmeisterin and her
sour-visaged sister Sittmann.</p>

<p>In each town and village the procession was greeted with
commanded cheers and with triumphant arches decorated by
her Excellency's instructions. The peasants' faces were sombre
while they cheered, sometimes a suppressed snarl of hatred
mingled with the acclamations. As the travellers proceeded
on their journey, however, this hostility abated, giving place
to peering curiosity, and at every halt the villagers crowded
round asking which of the ladies was the Landhofmeisterin,
and commenting on her appearance.</p>

<p>At Kehl on the Rhine there was an official reception by the
burgomaster and chief citizens. From Kehl to Strassburg,
a distance of several miles, peasants and townsfolk bordered
the road, watching the entry of the magnificent Duke of
Wirtemberg. The town of Strassburg, in those days only
French by a recent treaty, received the German prince with
vociferous delight. The Regent d'Orl&eacute;ans, wishful to show
courtesy to the new Duke of Montb&eacute;liard, had commanded the
garrison to render military honours to the travelling prince,
and Serenissimus was greeted in Strassburg by some of the
finest of France's troops, and by thundering cannon salutes.
Then there were white-robed maidens strewing flowers before
his horse's hoofs, and from the town-gate to the stately old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[<a href="./images/285.png">285</a>]</span>
Cathedral Square the concourse of men and women was so vast
as to make the progress slow and difficult; bands played and
flags flew, and the Gr&auml;venitz was delighted. Eberhard Ludwig
was feasted and honoured, and ever beside him was the tall
figure of the Landhofmeisterin. In the evening the Duke
received the chief burghers at a state banquet, and the
Gr&auml;venitz sat to his Highness's right.</p>

<p>In Schlettstadt and Belfort, where he entered the M&ouml;mpelgard
territory, the reception was enthusiastic; and, contrary to
all expectations, the citizens of M&ouml;mpelgard itself received
their new ruler with expressions of ecstatic loyalty, and even
the Landhofmeisterin was loudly cheered. Here again the
cannon roared a welcome, children and maidens strewed roses,
choirs of youths chanted p&aelig;ans of homage and rejoicing, and
the M&ouml;mpelgard regiments, which but a few months before
had been employed by the bastards to oppose the rightful
heir, now greeted their Duke with respect. Banners waved
from every house, arches of fresh flowers adorned the streets,
the windows were spread with silken hangings, and the church
bells rang peal upon peal. It was a scene of rejoicing, of
enthusiasm, of pomp and magnificence, and it was the culminating
point of the triumph of Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz,
but her heart was heavy with foreboding.</p>

<p>Serenissimus also, though he played his part in the fine
pageant with seeming pleasure, was filled with profound sadness.
The Erbprincessin had been brought to bed of a daughter
only since the loss of her first child. The Erbprinz was more
ailing than ever; true, he fought gallantly against his weakness,
seeking to fortify himself and please his father by outdoor
exercises; but, though he rode magnificently, with skill and
intrepidity, he had fallen fainting from his horse several times
of late. The doctors shook their heads, and the cognizance
forced itself upon Eberhard Ludwig that he himself would be
the last Duke of the direct line.</p>

<p>After spending three weeks of feasting at M&ouml;mpelgard, his
Highness set out for Stuttgart. The M&ouml;mpelgarders bade him
adieu with many expressions of loyal devotion. They found
their new Duke and his handsome, decorous mistress, who
played so finely the r&ocirc;le of legal Duchess, an agreeable change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[<a href="./images/286.png">286</a>]</span>
after Leopold Eberhard's 'Persian Court' and its absurdities,
and they would fain have induced Serenissimus to tarry in
M&ouml;mpelgard; but the King of Prussia had intimated his
intention of visiting Ludwigsburg in September, and Eberhard
Ludwig hurried back to receive his royal guest. But on
arriving in Ludwigsburg his Highness fell ill, and Friedrich
Wilhelm's visit was postponed till the following spring.</p>

<p>The winter passed with little incident at Ludwigsburg.
His Highness recovered rapidly from his actual illness, yet he
did not regain his accustomed health and spirits, and thus the
court festivities were both fewer and less brilliant than heretofore.
The Landhofmeisterin's forebodings seemed to be
infectious; a cloud hung over Ludwigsburg, and the people
murmured ominously: 'His Highness wearies of her, and she
has ill-wished him; he will die, and she will disappear with
all the jewels and gold.'</p>

<p>Doubtless, the Landhofmeisterin's actions lent colour to
these wild reports. She had studied various theories of
medicine&mdash;quaint, old, forgotten herb lore, absurd medi&aelig;val
magic. At first it had diverted her, then she grew credulous,
and in the despair of knowing Eberhard Ludwig's love to be
waning and his health broken, she resorted to the pitiful
puerilities of love potions, life essences, and elixirs. Of
course, for the brewing of these concoctions she required some
extraordinary ingredients, and it was in the procuring of
these that the gossip concerning her witch practices was
revived and flourished. This prescription required the blood
of a still-born male child; one old black-letter book recommended
the heart of a yellow hen; another ordered the life-warm
entrails of a black fighting-cock; a fourth prescription
commanded the admixture of hairs from a dead man's beard!
These ingredients mixed with herbs plucked in churchyards
at midnight, or spices brought directly from the East, and with
seven times distilled water, and suchlike, made a life elixir,
or an infallible love potion, or again a cure for this or that
disease. Among the many absurdities of ignorance some of
the accumulated wisdom of experience may have crept into
the old recipes: a real cure for a fever, or the application of
a gold ring to an inflamed eyelid. Superstition said that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[<a href="./images/287.png">287</a>]</span>
ring was the marvel-worker; possibly it was some quality in the
gold, some even-as-yet-undiscovered power of certain metals
upon the human body, and which experience may have taught
the old village woman and the wandering quack. But for the
most part the Gr&auml;venitz's potions were harmless absurdities,
yet she believed, and so did others, in their efficacy.</p>

<p>During the winter the Erbprinz's fainting fits were more
frequent than ever, and the Erbprincessin sank into a deep
and brooding melancholy, which was varied by attacks of
painful excitement and sudden bursts of causeless anger. It
was whispered at Ludwigsburg that she was surely going mad.</p>

<p>It was as though some fearful blight had fallen upon Eberhard
Ludwig and his family, and the Pietists preached that
the avenging hand of God was hovering over the sinner's
court. The Secret Service reported these sermons to the
Landhofmeisterin, and the preachers were fined or imprisoned,
but the stream of denunciation continued nevertheless.</p>

<p>The Gr&auml;venitz was very lonely now. His Highness had
changed to her, she could no longer blind herself to the fact.
Madame de Ruth was dead; Zollern, old and sad, was rarely at
Ludwigsburg. Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz was covertly hostile to her.
In the autumn a serious quarrel had taken place; the brother
demanding as free gift the property of Welzheim, which the
Landhofmeisterin had lent him. This Wilhelmine refused; she
did not relish her brother's way of asking, and she bitterly
resented the pompous, self-righteous, disapproving manner
which he had adopted towards her of late. After all, he owed
her everything, she told herself. Her sister, Sittmann, was a
useless parasite. The Landhofmeisterin accounted her as one
who would desert her immediately did misfortune come. The
Sittmann sons, young men who owed their high position
entirely to their aunt's power, not to their own merit or
capability, were colourless, insipid youths. Sittmann himself,
Sch&uuml;tz and the rest, she knew to be fair-weather friends;
evidently they descried the clouds gathering over their
patroness's head, and they were quietly drawing back from
her. Only Maria, the maid, remained faithful and admiring,
and tended her adored mistress with unfailing patience and
devotion. In the early spring the preparations began for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>
King of Prussia's visit, but Serenissimus himself took the lead
in settling the arrangements, and the Landhofmeisterin was
constantly met with the answer: 'His Highness has ordered
that otherwise, your Excellency,' or, 'that point has been
settled by the Duke.' For twenty years she had directed
and ruled, and now all things seemed to crumble at her
touch.</p>

<p>King Friedrich Wilhelm <span class="smcap">i.</span> arrived in Wirtemberg towards
the middle of April. He was met at the frontier by Eberhard
Ludwig and the whole Silver Guard. The cavalcade was very
brilliant, the horses magnificent, and the bluff Prussian King
greeted the Duke with rough cordiality. They had been companions-in-arms
during the Spanish Succession campaigns, and
as they rode together through the beautiful spring land of
Wirtemberg they recalled old memories, fighting over again
the battles of Blenheim, or of Malplaquet, and talking of
military matters. It was like a breath of the camp life of
long ago, of those young, gay, adventurous days when the
Future promised so much!</p>

<p>An official reception had been prepared for Friedrich Wilhelm
at Ludwigsburg, and leaving the King at Heilbronn,
Eberhard Ludwig hastened home. On the morrow, at the
head of his troops, he would receive Prussia's martial ruler
at a grand parade, after which the Corporal King was to be
feasted at the palace.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig reached Ludwigsburg late in the evening,
and retired immediately, commanding a light supper to be
served in his apartments. He was told that the Landhofmeisterin
and the court awaited him, and that supper was
already served, as usual, in her Excellency's dining-room.
But Serenissimus sent word that he desired to be undisturbed,
and prayed her Excellency to excuse him.</p>

<p>The supper at the Landhofmeisterin's table was partaken
of in a constrained atmosphere. Her Excellency spoke with
Baron Sch&uuml;tz of political affairs, but though her lips smiled,
there was that in her eyes which banished easy talk in her
presence. The Erbprinz was pale and silent; he had ridden
much during the afternoon, and had swooned away in the
palace courtyard when he dismounted. The Erbprincessin sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>
crumbling her bread with her long, delicate fingers, a heavy
cloud of aimless melancholy on her face. She had been
feverishly excited during the day at the prospect of meeting
her cousin King Friedrich Wilhelm, but, as usual, her passing
brighter mood left her the more depressed. At the repast's
conclusion the Landhofmeisterin rose and repaired, according
to her custom, to the card-room. She played her hand at
l'hombre, winning each game.</p>

<p>'Those who are fortunate at cards are unfortunate in all
else, they say,' she remarked, as she noted her winnings in her
neat scholarly handwriting. The courtiers murmured some
banal phrases, and Sch&uuml;tz watched the Landhofmeisterin
narrowly. Was it time for this Master-Rat to conduct his
brood away from the threatened vessel? he wondered.</p>

<p>Earlier than usual her Excellency gave the signal to retire.
'We start to-morrow at nine of the clock for his Majesty's
reception. Your Highness will occupy my coach. I trust it
will not rain,' she said indifferently as she bade the Erbprincessin
good-night. Now, it had been clearly understood that
no ladies were to attend the reception. In fact, the Erbprincessin
had consented to greet her cousin in private, only in
order to prevent the Landhofmeisterin from meeting the
mistress-hating monarch. There ensued an awkward pause
after her Excellency's speech.</p>

<p>'I do not purpose to be present at the official reception,
Madame,' said the Erbprincessin, 'and I had understood that
your Excellency also would remain away.'</p>

<p>'Your Highness has been misinformed,' returned the Landhofmeisterin
icily. 'We start, as I have had the honour to
tell you, at nine of the clock to-morrow morning. I wish you
would accompany me in my coach, Prince Friedrich, it would
be a happiness to me to have your protection. May I count
on you?' She turned to him with her wonderful smile. Friedrich
Ludwig had a place in her affection, and though he never
visited her at Favorite or Freudenthal, which wounded her
deeply, she bore him no malice.</p>

<p>'In truth, Madame, I shall be proud to escort you in your
coach to-morrow. At nine of the clock?' And he bade her
good rest. He was grateful to her for thus making it seem a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[<a href="./images/290.png">290</a>]</span>
courtesy to her that he should consent to drive instead of
riding to the review, for the doctor had told him that evening
that he could not ride, and he felt so weak and giddy after
his swoon that he knew he dared not mount a horse. The
Erbprincessin shot a veiled look of hatred at the Landhofmeisterin.
How well the evil woman knew how to cajole
men to her will!</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin repaired to her pavilion, and Maria
assisted her to bed. Such a ceremony it was, this retiring to
rest of the Landhofmeisterin! Such a profusion of delicious
essences; all the perfumes of Araby were used, and she donned
the fairest raiment of fine linen. According to custom, Maria
left her fastidious mistress ready for sleep and reading a heavy
tome of old-world magic by the light of two tall waxen tapers.</p>

<p>Hardly had the maid's footsteps ceased to echo on the stone
steps of the pavilion, when the Gr&auml;venitz flung aside the
book and, rising from her chair, listened attentively. Only
the monotonous tramp of the sentries in the courtyard, and,
more faintly, the same sound from the guards on the north
terrace. Still her Excellency listened. Alas! for how many
nights of late had she hearkened in vain for the click of the
little key in the door from the statue gallery? Eberhard
Ludwig never came to her, and as she stood listening her
heart bled in anguish for the love that was no more. Could
such love really die? she asked herself. If it could, then the
vows Eberhard Ludwig had spoken were mockery. Had she
built her life on so insecure a foundation? The whole
fabric of her being was shattered. Her anguish was almost
physical pain, and she knew why people said 'my heart
bleeds,' for, of a truth, it seemed to her as though the strength
ebbed away from her heart, leaving an aching, yearning void.
Courage! she would try again. She lifted the waxen taper
and held it between her face and the mirror. Yes, there
were lines beneath the eyes; her cheeks were less full and
her chin heavier than of yore, but her lips were soft and red,
her eyes as blue, as vivid as they had ever been. She knew
her hair was streaked with white beneath the powder, but it
was still luxuriant. She was beautiful, desirable&mdash;but would
he desire her? She replaced the taper, glided into the statue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>
gallery, and opened the door leading to his Highness's room.
She listened; Eberhard Ludwig was asleep; she could hear the
long, even breaths. Noiselessly she pushed aside the arras and
entered. The moon shone into the room, and again she could
have vowed that a white-shrouded woman's figure stood in
the wan light, but, as before, the faint vision vanished when
she looked more searchingly.</p>

<p>'Eberhard, beloved,' she called gently, 'are you ill?' The
old witchery was in her voice, and the sleeping man answered
to it.</p>

<p>'I come, sweet love; I come, Philom&egrave;le!' Serenissimus
appeared on the threshold of the writing-room. He had flung
himself down to sleep without undressing, and was still in his
riding-clothes. He looked ghastly in the pale moonlight, and
she hurried to him with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>'You are ill and you do not come to me? Beloved, have
I not tended you that you should thus flaunt me?' She
drew him to her. 'What have I done, my heart, how have I
sinned, that you have taken your love from me? See, I come
to you to pray you to forgive me!' The old trick of speech,
her catchword, 'See,' the low voice&mdash;the soft, strong arms.</p>

<p>He had doubted her, and why? She had given him all; it
was not her fault if he wearied of her tyranny. No; he alone
was to blame, his inconstancy, his weakness. He poured
forth a torrent of self-reproach, and words of love, and she
responded passionately. Once more they were lovers, thrilling
to each other's touch. And the wan moon looked on at their
transports, and perchance the pale wraith of the Countess of
Orlam&uuml;nde, the White Lady, watched the lovers and smiled,
knowing that love's death, satiety, had them in his chill grip
for all their passionate vows.</p>

<p>'I start at nine to-morrow morning for the reception,
beloved. The Erbprincessin and Friedrich accompany me in
my coach,' the Landhofmeisterin said as she prepared to return
to her apartments. His Highness started.</p>

<p>'I pray you, do not go, Wilhelmine. The King is a bear,
and if you meet him he will fail in courtesy to you,' he said.</p>

<p>'It is my right to go, and I start at nine,' she repeated.</p>

<p>'You shall not go; it is my right to forbid you,&mdash;you shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>
not go!' he cried. Then ensued a quarrel, bitter, terrible,
between two beings who so short a while before had loved so
madly. The quarrel ended by the man giving in, as usual, but
the wrangle pierced one more nail in his love's coffin for all that.</p>

<hr />

<p>True to her word, the next morning at nine of the clock
the Landhofmeisterin entered her coach accompanied by a
very angry-faced Erbprincessin, and the Erbprinz. They
drove past Hohenasperg to the plain where the review was
to be held, and the Landhofmeisterin's coach took up a
commanding position near to Eberhard Ludwig and the
officers of his staff. The Prussian King appeared riding with
a numerous retinue.</p>

<p>The field artillery spluttered volleys, and the cannon of
Hohenasperg thundered a royal salute; the Silver Guard and
the Chevaliergarde deployed and went through the series of
antics customary at that period of military history. It was a
small quantity of men with which to aspire to give a military
display to the Soldier King, but under Eberhard Ludwig's
zealous care the men were perfectly drilled, wonderfully
accoutred, and the cavalry horses were unequalled in Germany.
The light field-guns were of the latest invention, the artillery
and fort gunnery were carefully distinguished according to the
new military rule: in fact, it was all rigidly correct and perfect
to the most approved and newest methods of that date; and
Friedrich Wilhelm who, if he knew little else, was a past
master of the martial art, was delighted at the display. But
his face changed when he rode up to the coach to greet his
cousin, and became aware of the Landhofmeisterin's presence.</p>

<p>'Why are you here?' he grumbled to the Erbprincessin.
'Women are best at home, looking after the children or
cooking the dinner.'</p>

<p>'May I present her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin to
your Majesty?' said Eberhard Ludwig; but the King turned a
deaf ear.</p>

<p>'Go home, cousin, go home!' he bawled at the Erbprincessin;
and putting spurs to his horse galloped away to inspect
some new pattern of field-gun which his sharp eyes had espied
with the artillery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[<a href="./images/293.png">293</a>]</span>
Eberhard Ludwig looked at the Landhofmeisterin in genuine
distress. He had warned her of the Prussian King's rough
manners, but this was more than he had expected. Her
Excellency's face was inscrutable.</p>

<p>'I should advise your Highness to follow that most kingly
personage. Keep him in view, Serenissimus, or he may steal a
tall man or so for his grenadiers from among your favourite
guards. It is one of his graceful habits, I am told,' she said
coldly.</p>

<p>The Erbprinz had flushed deeply when the martial king
ignored the Landhofmeisterin. The Erbprincessin's face, on
the contrary, had lightened considerably. It was delightful
to see the Gr&auml;venitz put down for once! They drove home
through the meadows, past the blossoming orchards, and never
had the Landhofmeisterin been more charming; even the
Erbprincessin could not forbear a smile at her witty sayings,
and the Erbprinz laughed gaily. The Prussian King rode
past the coach, glaring at its occupants with his protuberant
eyes, and the Landhofmeisterin adroitly launched a witticism
just as his Majesty was passing, in order that he should suffer
the mortification of hearing and seeing their merriment half
an hour after his unmannerly slight. Her ruse succeeded
admirably, and she had the pleasure of observing the King's
brick-coloured face flush to purple with anger.</p>

<p>The Duke and his guest remained together all the morning<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.'">,</ins>
His Highness showing the King each detail of the palace. In
the orangery they came across two remarkably tall garden
boys, and Friedrich Wilhelm immediately offered Eberhard
Ludwig three hundred thalers apiece for them. Now, they
happened to be her Excellency's own gardeners, and to be
proficient in the art of cultivating roses, so Serenissimus
prayed the King to let him find other giants for him; these, he
said, were not his to offer.</p>

<p>'Whose then? Whose then? What the devil! Why, the
houndsdirts must belong to you! Whose can they be? If
they are my little cousin's I will soon make her see I will
have them,' the Prussian monarch shouted.</p>

<p>'They belong to her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin,
sire.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
'What, that woman? Ha! you took her to M&ouml;mpelgard, I
hear! Ridiculous things, women&mdash;want the lash, the whip.
Do you hear, old comrade?&mdash;every woman wants the lash.
Look at my daughter now&mdash;absurd hussy! will not marry. I
ought to lash her, but she hides behind her mother's petticoats.
Ridiculous things, women.'</p>

<p>Serenissimus endeavoured to lead the shouting monarch
from the orangery, but he was not to be outdone.</p>

<p>'Come to Berlin, boy; fine uniforms, good beer, and tobacco.
Come, you will love me like your father!' he yelled at the
tallest gardener, bestowing a heavy blow on the youth's
shoulders with the stout cudgel which he always carried. The
end of it was that Eberhard Ludwig made him a present of
the Landhofmeisterin's gardeners, and the King in high good
humour retired to take an hour's nap before starting to enjoy
some wild-boar sticking in the forest.</p>

<p>All that day the Landhofmeisterin did not see Serenissimus,
only in the afternoon she received a billet from him in
which he forbade her to attend the supper in the state
banqueting-hall. 'The Erbprincessin will be the only lady;
she, being the King's cousin, must attend, but I command you
to remain away. You will understand my reasons when you
consider the events of this morning.&mdash;E. L.'</p>

<p>The letter was short, formal, cold in tone, and the Landhofmeisterin
was deeply wounded. She had known that Friedrich
Wilhelm would be unfriendly to her; his rough virtue, and
hatred of illicit relationships, were famous throughout
Germany, and she was aware that he would view with displeasure
the magnificence and the French manners of Ludwigsburg.
Had he not stamped, beaten, and roared out of
existence every trace of the elegance and pomp of the Berlin
court as it had been under his father, Friedrich <span class="smcap">i.</span>?&mdash;that
monarch who, by the way, had granted the Gr&auml;venitz that
Letter of Royal Protection twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Still, though Friedrich Wilhelm had refused to ratify or
acknowledge this document when begged to do so by the
Duke of Zollern, the Landhofmeisterin had counted him as
more or less bound by it, and the idea that he could utterly
ignore her had never entered her head. Moreover, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>
thought she would not need the protection of Prussia. She
had prepared a vast fortune out of Wirtemberg, and if death
claimed Eberhard Ludwig before her own demise, she intended
to retire to Schaffhausen and finish her days in magnificent
seclusion. Yet it was infinitely galling to be hidden away in
this manner. She raged at the thought of the courtiers'
sneers. Not attend the supper? She, the ruler of Ludwigsburg
and Wirtemberg, to be hidden like a common mistress!
And then how coldly Eberhard Ludwig wrote to her. 'Alas!
all things pass,' she said, and wept bitterly. The day wore
on. She tried to read, to occupy herself, but she could not fix
her mind on anything; her thoughts reverted to her humiliation.
At last she heard the noise of the sportsmen's return,
and Friedrich Wilhelm's loud voice shouting and laughing.
Would Eberhard Ludwig come to her now? But no; she
waited, and no one disturbed her solitude.</p>

<p>At length Maria brought her a tray covered with dishes of
delicious viands.</p>

<p>'If her Excellency refuses to be served properly in the
dining-room, as usual, she must at least have a mouthful to
eat,' the honest soul declared, and she hovered round the
Gr&auml;venitz, imploring her to taste this or that, to drink a little
wine; but the Landhofmeisterin pushed away her plate, saying
that the food choked her, and Maria, grumbling, carried away
the untasted supper.</p>

<p>Once more, Wilhelmine fell to listening. She heard the
noise of a crowd gathering in the courtyard. She rang her
handbell, and when Maria appeared she questioned her on
the reason of a crowd being admitted to the palace precincts.
His Highness had commanded the gates to be thrown open,
she was told; it was the Prussian King's custom to permit the
populace to see him eat.</p>

<p>'Disgusting!' quoth the Landhofmeisterin haughtily. 'I
can smell the varlets from here. Sprinkle rose-water about
the room, Maria.'</p>

<p>The hours dragged on monotonously. The noise of the
crowd in the courtyard was drowned by the loud strains of the
massed bands of the regiments in Ludwigsburg, who had been
commanded to play before the windows of the banqueting-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>hall.
The Landhofmeisterin's musicians with their harps,
violins, and flutes were banished during the Prussian King's
visit, for he hated all music save that of trumpet and drum.
At length the Landhofmeisterin could bear her solitude and
suspense no longer. She slipped into the statue gallery, and
through a secret door to the Duke's private stairs. The topmost
flight led to a small gallery which looked into the
banqueting-hall. She had often watched from here the
hunting dinners which his Highness gave, and from
which ladies were naturally excluded. It was many years
since one of these entertainments had taken place, and
the staircase had fallen into disrepair; it was dirty and dusty,
and creaked under her Excellency's tread. 'Disgraceful
neglect! the housekeeper-in-charge shall be fined,' murmured
the tyrant as she mounted. The door leading to the gallery
was ajar. The Landhofmeisterin's face darkened with anger.
Had some serving-maids dared to creep up to watch the doings
in the banqueting-hall? But there was no one in the gallery,
and she bent down, peering through the stucco balustrade into
the hall below. Her attention was arrested by a cackling
snigger behind her&mdash;a horrid, mocking, wheezy titter in the
shadow of the overhanging ornamentation of the banqueting-hall
roof, which came low down over the little gallery. She
turned quickly and saw the grotesque, ape-like figure of one
of the court dwarfs. Her Excellency had introduced these
hideous abortions into Ludwigsburg, having read that they
were a feature of the Spanish court in its grandest days.
Eberhard Ludwig, disgusted at the sight of the puny monstrosities,
had refused to permit them to go about the palace,
and they had been relegated, poor displeasing toys, to the
servants' regions. Here they were kicked and cuffed and
made cruel sport of. During the foregoing winter one dwarf had
died, and the other roamed around like some miserable outcast
cur, lurking in dark corners, hiding from all living things,
which he accounted rightly as his tormentors. He cowered
before the Landhofmeisterin, laughing his horrible, cackling
snigger, which was half mockery, half terror. He expected
the Landhofmeisterin to push him brutally aside, but her
sorrow had made her suddenly gentle; she felt dimly that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
wretched creature was an outcast, and so was she. 'Poor
dwarf,' she said gently, 'I had thought you were dead! So
you still wander in this vale of tears?' She spoke almost
mockingly, and yet there was that in her tone which gave
hope to the wretched being.</p>

<p>'O Madame, I am so miserable! They beat me, cuff me,
the serving-maids pinch me, scratch me with their bodkins!
They say you are hard and cold and cruel, but oh, have
mercy on me!'</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> hard and cold and cruel?' she replied incredulously.
'Do they say that?' She had no idea that success and
prosperity had thus changed her; the world-hardened never
know it themselves.</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, they say that; but, I pray you, have mercy on me.'
The poor, distorted figure threw itself down, grovelling at the
Landhofmeisterin's feet.</p>

<p>'Go to my apartments in the pavilion and await me, I
will attend to you in an hour's time. Stay, here is my ring;
show that to the sentry and he will admit you,' she said.
She would send him back to his Swiss mountain valley with
gold enough to last him for his lifetime. Perhaps, if she did
good to this outcast, God would relent, would give her back
Eberhard Ludwig's love? The dwarf went, and the Landhofmeisterin
turned her attention to the scene in the banqueting-hall.</p>

<p>The banquet was finished, but the guests still sat round the
table with wine-reddened faces. The Prussian King loved to
drink deep; he said he abhorred the milksop who could not
follow him to the dregs of a tankard, and that was indeed no
paltry measure. The Erbprincessin sat to the King's right,
his Highness himself was on his Majesty's left. The Erbprinz,
white and weary, sat opposite. The holders of important
court charges were grouped around according to their respective
ranks. Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz, as Count of the Empire and
Prime Minister of Wirtemberg, sat to the left of Serenissimus;
Prelate Osiander came next, then Sch&uuml;tz and Sittmann, and
the brothers Pfau. Reischach, the Master of the Hunt; Baron
Roeder, Master of the Horse; the Oberhofmarshall, the other
Geheimr&auml;the; the generals and officers of his Highness's staff;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[<a href="./images/298.png">298</a>]</span>
the colonels of the Silver Guard, of the Chevaliergarde; the
young captain of the Cadets &agrave; Cheval. Among the Wirtemberg
courtiers were seated various members of the Prussian
suite: Grumbkow, the powerful favourite; General D&ouml;nhoff;
and the Austrian Ambassador at Berlin, Count Seckendorff,
who always followed Friedrich Wilhelm <span class="smcap">i.</span>, a spy and intriguer
in friendship's guise.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant assemblage, but it was well to be seen
that deep drinking had been indulged in. Besides the
Erbprincessin, only Osiander and the Erbprinz had calm and
unflushed faces. The Landhofmeisterin's eyes wandered from
Friedrich Wilhelm to Eberhard Ludwig; his face was flushed,
and he swayed a little in his chair. His Highness was
usually a moderate drinker, and, though during his various
campaigns he had drunk and revelled like the rest, the
Landhofmeisterin had never seen him with that vacant, sottish
look, and her soul sickened at the sight. The Erbprincessin
rose and took her leave, Friedrich Wilhelm shouting rough,
good-natured pleasantries to her. Then his Majesty's friend,
Grumbkow, craving the Duke's permission, called the lackey
in charge, who produced the King's huge pipe, and in a few
minutes the Landhofmeisterin saw the stately banqueting-hall
take the aspect and smell of a tabagie. Dense clouds of
smoke rose up, and she saw that the Prussian King was again
served with an enormous jug of beer. The banqueting-hall
was transformed, no trace of elegance or courtly grace seemed
to remain; it had become a pothouse, of which Eberhard
Ludwig was the jovial host. The Landhofmeisterin quivered
with disgust, his Highness appeared sunken to a different level.
She watched and listened; the music in the courtyard had
ceased, and she could hear what they said in the banqueting-hall.</p>

<p>'What! Sapperment! you compose fiddling tunes, young
man?' Friedrich Wilhelm was roaring at the shrinking
Erbprinz. 'Just like my fool of a son. He blows squeaks
on a tube which he calls my beloved flute' (the King gave a
rough imitation of his son's refined speech). 'No good at
all, this younger generation&mdash;eh! what, old comrade? A good
fight, a good glass of beer, a good pipe, a good wife&mdash;that's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[<a href="./images/299.png">299</a>]</span>
what a man needs; no French jiggery and music nonsense.
Fool's play&mdash;eh, what? what?' He spoke in German; such
German as it was, too, vitiated by French words which
he could not avoid, as he knew no others, adorned with
unquotable oaths, short-clipped, rough phrases&mdash;the language
of the man-at-arms in the guard-room. Yet he possessed a
certain breezy charm, and Eberhard Ludwig seemed to
respond to it. In truth, the King, when he was not in one
of his furious rages, was a boon companion, and appealed to
the brutish swagger which lies dormant in every man's
being.</p>

<p>At length the company rose from table and gathered in
groups of three or four, while the King and his host retired
into the embrasure of one of the windows. The Landhofmeisterin
saw that Friedrich Wilhelm spoke earnestly to
Serenissimus; she noted the embarrassment on the Duke's
face, he seemed like a chidden schoolboy, and with dismay
the Landhofmeisterin observed that he was evidently impressed
by the King's words. Could this rude monarch
persuade so polished and refined a being as Eberhard
Ludwig? Did he endeavour to separate her lover from
her? A presentiment came to her; she knew instinctively
that this was what the King essayed. After nearly an hour,
the two men came forth from the window's embrasure, and
she saw how the King held out his hand to Eberhard Ludwig,
and how his Highness gripped and held it, saying something
in a low, earnest tone.</p>

<p>She strained her ears, yet she could not catch the words;
but she saw Friedrich Wilhelm's satisfied face. He clapped
his Highness between the shoulders with a heavy hand.
Evidently Serenissimus met with his Majesty's entire approval.
The company broke up for the night, and the Landhofmeisterin
rose from her cramped, kneeling position and took her way
back to her apartments. A cruel foreknowledge of disaster
overshadowed her; something unusual, elusively sinister,
haunted her.</p>

<p>As she passed his Highness's door she hesitated. Should
she go in bravely and speak her fear to him? Pride forbade,
and a certain sense of hopelessness. She drew herself up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[<a href="./images/300.png">300</a>]</span>
proudly. No, he loved her; how could he change after twenty
years? He could not escape her, for she was his life; all his
memories were hers, his past, his present; therefore she
argued, as a woman always argues, his future too must be
hers.</p>

<p>She passed into her apartments and, opening her window,
leaned far out. How silent it was in the garden! The moonlight
played gently over the terraces, only the splash of the
fountains broke the stillness. The air was delicious, scented
with freshness, and after the noisome fumes of wine, beer,
victuals, and tobacco in the banqueting-hall, she thought
the night air was laden with rose fragrance. So it had been
on that far-off night in the Stuttgart palace gardens after the
theatricals. Time had not played havoc then with Nature.
How weary she was! Suddenly a moan in the room behind
her attracted her attention. She started nervously, and, as
usual, the thought of the White Lady worked in her mind.
They said the poor ghost moaned when death drew near to
any of her descendants, and she was Eberhard Ludwig's
ancestress. The Landhofmeisterin dared not turn her head
for fear she should see a tall, white, shrouded figure with
bloodstained hands. Again the moan.</p>

<p>'Who is there?' the Landhofmeisterin said tremulously.</p>

<p>'Pardon, Madame, you said I was to await you.' It was
only the dwarf, then. Her Excellency almost laughed in her
relief.</p>

<p>'Ah! I had forgotten you. Well, tell me your story
now. I am listening,' she said. It would serve to pass the
time till his Highness came, for he would come, she told
herself.</p>

<p>The dwarf stood trembling before her, ridiculous, grotesque<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing comma">,</ins>
infinitely pathetic. He poured forth the tale of his miserable
life, of the taunts, the jeers, the kicks, the cuffs, the lack of
food which he had often suffered in the midst of the lavish
splendour of Ludwigsburg. Incidentally he let her see how
the very servants of the palace spoke of her, and how they
mocked her authority when they dared.</p>

<p>His was a pitiful life-history, and the Landhofmeisterin was
moved to compassion; her own heart was sore, and already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[<a href="./images/301.png">301</a>]</span>
the crust of world-hardness had begun to melt under the
tears which were welling up ready to be shed.</p>

<p>She told the dwarf that he was free to return to that
humble cottage in the Swiss valley which he called home.
There and then she wrote out a passport for him and an
order for a seat in the Duke's diligence as far as the frontier;
she gave him a purse of gold, and, more precious still, an
official command to all to treat the deformed traveller with
consideration; also, as postscriptum, an intimation that if
the dwarf did not reach his home safe and unrobbed, she
would cause the whole Secret Service to track the offender,
who would suffer the utmost penalty of the law. With this
document the dwarf could have travelled from one end of
Wirtemberg to the other in safety; nay, more, he was sure
of even servile acceptance from high and low, for never was
monarch so feared in his domains as the G&uuml;strow adventuress
in the Dukedom of Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>'God reward you for this great good,' the dwarf said as he
turned to leave her presence, and she answered sadly:</p>

<p>'It is too late; God's hand is heavy upon me.' But she
did not believe it.</p>

<p>The hours passed, and still the Landhofmeisterin waited for
Eberhard Ludwig. She watched the grey dawn slip into the
sky, then the glow of the awaking sun came, and she knew
that she waited in vain.</p>

<h3>SATIETY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Friedrich Wilhelm</span> and his Highness of Wirtemberg started
early on the morning after the state banquet. A number of
wild boars had been tracked in the Kernen forest and good sport
was anticipated. The Landhofmeisterin from her couch heard
the stir of the sportsmen's departure. In happier days she
had waved farewell to her lover from her window, now she
turned her face to the wall and moaned in anguish. But
the day's routine should be carried out as usual, that she
vowed; no one should pity her, no one notice that she feared
her sun had set. She dressed according to her wont in a
magnificent gown, sat patiently for an hour in her powdering
closet while the obsequious Frenchman dressed her hair
elaborately and powdered the curls afresh.</p>

<p>She reflected grimly on the blessings of powder to age-silvering
locks; none would see that her black hair was
streaked with white.</p>

<p>Her step had never been prouder than when she walked
through her empty antehall which, but a few days earlier,
had been filled with a bowing crowd of courtiers. She was
almost surprised to find Baron Sch&uuml;tz awaiting her as usual
in the 'Landhofmeisterin's business-room,' that small room on
the ground floor of the west pavilion whence for twenty
years had issued the ruling orders of Wirtemberg. She
worked as she had done each morning for many years.
Sitting at the large middle table she transacted the business
of the Dukedom. Beside her was a pile of unwritten papers
signed at the bottom of each page by Eberhard Ludwig. It
was only needful to write any decree above his Highness's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[<a href="./images/303.png">303</a>]</span>
signature, to affix his seal beneath, and to add her own official
name 'W. von Gr&auml;venitz-W&uuml;rben, pro Landhofmeister Wirtembergs,'
to make the writing an unassailable, all-powerful,
official document. Gradually things had come to this pass.
The Duke preferred hunting, shooting, riding, to affairs of
State, and in the course of years the Gr&auml;venitz had succeeded in
grasping complete, autocratic power. There was no one to
hinder her; her brother was Prime Minister in name, but he
was forced to bring each important matter to her, for she
represented his Highness.</p>

<p>The Geheimr&auml;the were one and all her creatures; the Duke
refused to meddle, and if he expressed a wish, it was so
promptly and ostentatiously carried out that he never realised
how entirely he had ceded the reins of government to his
mistress. To the Landhofmeisterin's working-room came the
officers of the Secret Service, bringing their reports on the
doings of all Wirtembergers of high or low estate, each
report of value being carefully noted and locked away in the
wire-protected shelves which furnished the walls.</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin laboured, according to habit, on the
morning after the banquet, and if she detected a freer tone in
the heretofore obsequious Sch&uuml;tz's voice, a shade of insolence
in his manner, she gave no sign thereof. If anything, she
was more haughty, more dictatorial than ever.</p>

<p>'I am retiring to La Favorite for a few days' rest, Baron
Sch&uuml;tz,' she said, when the affairs of the day were accomplished;
'you will bring me any business which it is necessary
for me to consider. I shall have these with me'&mdash;she tapped
the signed pages&mdash;'the seal I shall also have with me. As I
am fatigued, I shall not work longer this morning. Au revoir,
Baron.' He was dismissed.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency would do well to leave me the signatures.
I may have need of them,' he said hurriedly, stretching out
his hand towards the pile of signed warrant papers.</p>

<p>'Since when can Baron Sch&uuml;tz dispose of his Highness's
signature? I have already told you that if urgent business
arises, in spite of my fatigue, I shall be prepared to attend to
it at La Favorite. Au revoir, Baron.'</p>

<p>She spoke resolutely, yet in a perfectly unconcerned voice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[<a href="./images/304.png">304</a>]</span>
and Sch&uuml;tz, fearing lest his observations had failed him, and
the 'great one' was after all not nearing her downfall, bowed
himself out with his accustomed obsequiousness. He would
have changed his mind could he have seen the cloud of
misery and anxiety which settled on her face directly she was
alone. She arranged various papers, extracting several from
the neatly docketed packets. These she regarded as instruments
in her hands; this document was a sword of Damocles
which she could suspend over the head of that enemy; this
other a pistol which, an she willed it, she could level at the
credit and honour of another; here a short report spelling
ruin to a noble family's pride; there a note to convict an
honoured courtier of fraud or of traitorous intrigue. If she
was indeed to fall, she would not alone be flung from her
eminence; those who had hated her should also be dragged
down with her. She smiled bitterly. After all, even though
she wreaked vengeance as she fell, what would it avail her?
This triumph of her spite would be a satisfaction, but&mdash;&mdash;She
sighed, and would have replaced the damning papers in
their hiding-place. No! she would take them with her. If
the crushing misfortune came, at least she would have the
consolation of retaining some power over others.</p>

<p>Sadly she mounted the stairs to her own apartments, and
calling the waiting-maid, she bade Maria gather together all
the jewels and gold; a few of her best-loved books; some of
her most gorgeous clothes. Grumbling, Maria packed them
in a huge nail-studded chest.</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin stood watching till the last chosen
object was safely packed away, then she bade Maria summon
lackeys from La Favorite. They came quickly, and her
Excellency ordered them to carry the chest to her little
Ch&acirc;teau Joyeux. Her voice was perfectly steady as she gave
these orders, her face stern and calm. Her whole action was
unhurried, deliberate; she might have been making arrangements
for a gay hunting expedition. There was no trace of
anxiety in her manner.</p>

<p>Maria hovered about, after the lackeys had departed with
the chest. Did her Excellency wish for this or that? Should
she accompany her Ladyship's Grace to La Favorite?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[<a href="./images/305.png">305</a>]</span>
Calmly the Landhofmeisterin bade her precede her, she would
follow in a few moments. She heard Maria locking the
wardrobes in the chamber below, listened to her giving orders
for the redding up of the apartments, exactly as she had
heard the maid finish her preparations for departure a
hundred times before starting for Urach or Freudenthal.</p>

<p>'Beloved, the coaches await us; shall we begin our journey?'
The Landhofmeisterin started. Yes; that was how Eberhard
Ludwig had summoned her in the old, happy days. Her
nerves had tricked her, it was only an echo of long ago.
Could everything, indeed, be ended? Was she leaving Ludwigsburg
for ever? Ah, no, no! how absurd! Of course
Serenissimus would recall her directly this blustering King
had gone back to his drill at Berlin! And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She moved slowly round her rooms. Fifteen years since
Frisoni had conducted her to her pavilion! She recalled how
she and Eberhard Ludwig had laughed at the little Italian's
ruse, when he led them up and down corridors and stairs in
order to reach her apartments from his Highness's rooms.
The memory of their mirth was torture to her. Once more
she took the key from her bosom and, passing through the
statue gallery, she gained the hiding-place behind the arras.
She listened, but there was no sound; she pressed the secret
spring of the tapestry door and entered the writing-closet.
Slowly she walked round the room; she had not come to rob
the bureau this time, nor to upbraid her lover, nor to tempt
him once again. No; she had come to bid farewell, to look
her last upon the familiar scene. One of the Duke's
gauntleted hunting-gloves lay on the floor; she stooped and
lifted it and put it to her lips. Then the full sense of her
loneliness came to her, and she sobbed aloud. She hurried
away, and her last vision of that well-known room was
blurred by her tears.</p>

<p>One parting look round her own apartments, and she
passed out on to the roofed terrace which led from the Corps
de Logis to the West Pavilion. Here her own face met her
on sculptured vaulting and ornamented wall. Her face, young,
smiling, voluptuous, surrounded by the emblems of music held
by Cupids. Love, music, and herself. What a mockery it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[<a href="./images/306.png">306</a>]</span>
seemed to her, this open homage, this enduring monument
of a dead passion!</p>

<p>With steady tread she paced down the flight of stone steps
to the second terrace. Again a statue with her features met
her eye. Frisoni had designed the pedestal. She remembered
how she had laughed at the Italian for drawing a figure of
Time with huge wings and holding giant sickle-blades in his
oversized hands. She had called it awkward and ill-conceived,
and the Italian had told her that Time was an awkward giant;
that he crushed strength and glory sometimes, and left weakness
and shame to live. She had hardly noted the answer
then, but it came back to her now. She looked at the sickle-blades
and shuddered, knowing that Time had mown her
down at last.</p>

<hr />

<p>All day the Landhofmeisterin busied herself with her books,
with playing upon the spinet, and singing her favourite songs.
She was a prey to fearful unrest. Night fell, the hunters had
returned, and yet his Highness sent no word to her he had
called 'Life of my Life.' Perchance he was much occupied.
The Prussian King was an exacting guest, she told herself;
framing excuses, reasons, all the pitiful resources of a woman's
heart, to explain away her beloved's coldness. The fact that
the courtiers held aloof from her caused her no pain, only
bitter anger, yet even for these she elaborated reasons of
absence. How often had she wearied of these people's importunities,
how often longed to be left in peace, and yet now
she would have given vast sums could she have seen her
antechamber full again. She knew that Friedrich Wilhelm's
visit would terminate on the morning following the wild-boar
sticking in the Kernen forest. Would he go, this rough,
virtue-loving despot? She remembered how he had tarried
four whole weeks at Dresden when he had paid a visit to
Augustus the Strong some years before. And this in spite
of his disapproval of the reigning favourite, the Countess
Orzelska, and the many lesser stars of that licentious court.
Good Heavens! would he stay four weeks at Ludwigsburg?
She smiled; even in her despair there was something humorous
in her being which no sadness could dull, and she found her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>
own dismay at the honoured guest's possible procrastination
a trifle comic.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig must come back to her&mdash;he must; she repeated
it over and over again. The night brought her no rest;
always the same hammering thought, the torturing, nagging
possibilities, the tangle of recollections. Sometimes she slipped
away for a few moments into a restless sleep, but her dreams
were as terrible as her waking thoughts. She was journeying in
her coach to Stetten, the horses galloped fast&mdash;ever faster!&mdash;Eberhard
Ludwig was at her side, then, with a gesture of
anger, he flung himself out of the carriage. She was alone,
and the horses were rushing onwards. A giant figure, of pitiless
face, stood in their way&mdash;a being with huge, gnarled hands
which held enormous sickle-blades. The horses were mown
down, now the blades were descending over her. 'Great God!
Mercy! he is cutting out my heart!' she awoke screaming.</p>

<p>Then the strain of agonised thought began once more to
whirl in her mind. Eberhard Ludwig must come back&mdash;he
must. She fell asleep, and again the Dream Demon took hold
of her. Now she was in Duke Christopher's Grotto in Stuttgart.
The mob was nearing her, and her feet always slipped
back on the slimy steps&mdash;she would never gain the first
gallery. A shadowy figure with bleeding hands barred her
way&mdash;the White Lady&mdash;the murderess. 'Back to the world
to take your punishment!' the ghost whispered, and oh, horror!
she pushed her back with those terrible, bleeding hands&mdash;<i>back</i>,
down the slippery, slimy steps towards the crowd.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig led the mob, and the Prussian King was
with him. 'Beloved of my life, heart of my soul!' the Duke
said, and clasped her to him; but his arms had become sickle-blades
and they cut her to the heart, while Friedrich Wilhelm
laughed and waved a cudgel. It hit her on the brow, blow
after blow. 'Wanton, wanton, witch and wanton!' the King
bawled at each stroke. She was dreaming; she knew it, she
must awake; but the Dream Demon had not done with her.
Now she was with W&uuml;rben, now with Madame de Ruth, now
at G&uuml;strow, now at Urach in the Golden Hall, but always the
glistening sickle-blades followed her. W&uuml;rben cut at her
with them; Madame de Ruth, Monsieur Gabriel, every one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[<a href="./images/308.png">308</a>]</span>
had got these searing blades, and always Eberhard Ludwig
stood watching, watching, and he did not save her!</p>

<p>In the grey dawn she awoke. It was all a dream, then.
What was wrong, though? There was something&mdash;ah, yes!
Eberhard Ludwig had ceased to love her. Absurd! It was
a phantasy of her weary brain! She was ill, feverish.&mdash;Eberhard
was occupied with an exacting guest, that was all.
He would come back to her&mdash;he must. At last she slept
dreamlessly. Fatigue conquered agony, and she slept.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Landhofmeisterin awoke to a smiling world. Such a
glory of Spring, of blossom and lilac. Maria threw open the
windows, and the sound of the gardeners raking the paths of
La Favorite gardens came in with the lilac scent. It was a
good world, a very young world! Alas! the Gr&auml;venitz felt old
and broken, ill from her night of agony. Maria told her that the
Prussian King had left Ludwigsburg. Very early the cavalcade
had started, and Serenissimus had ridden away with his guest.</p>

<p>'At what hour does his Highness return?' her Excellency
queried.</p>

<p>'Not for several days; they say his Highness stays at
Heilbronn to-night, and rides to the frontier with the
King to-morrow, then goes boar-sticking in the Maulbronn
forest, and will not return for four or five days,' the maid
answered. The Landhofmeisterin sighed; in happier days the
Duke had bidden her adieu tenderly, if he were forced to leave
her for an hour, and now&mdash;&mdash; But it was absurd; of course he
could not always worship her like a young lover, but he would
never desert her.</p>

<p>'Who is in the antehall this morning, Maria?' she asked.</p>

<p>'No one, your Excellency.'</p>

<p>So the parasites were dropping away from the threatened tree.</p>

<hr />

<p>All that day and the next, no one disturbed the solitude of
La Favorite, even Baron Sch&uuml;tz held aloof. On the third morning
the Landhofmeisterin sent for him, but the answer came
back that the Finance Minister had left Ludwigsburg for a
few days' rest. The Landhofmeisterin reflected grimly that
Baron Sch&uuml;tz had never needed repose before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[<a href="./images/309.png">309</a>]</span>
Eight days passed ere Eberhard Ludwig returned. The
Landhofmeisterin's fears had grown dim, habit had resumed
sway. She worked at the affairs of State each morning, and
save that the business was transacted at La Favorite instead
of at the palace, and that Baron Sch&uuml;tz was replaced by an
underling clerk, everything seemed to have lost that touch
of the unusual which is part of the menace of coming disaster.
True, the courtiers were scarcely assiduous in the
visiting of the Landhofmeisterin, but they dared not
absent themselves entirely, for they were uncertain as to her
fate, and they feared both her revenge and her reputed witchcraft.
So they repaired perfunctorily to La Favorite, and
though her Excellency refused to receive visitors, still she was
informed of the courtiers' visits. Thus the old life seemed to
be unaltered, and the Landhofmeisterin forgot her anxiety in
a measure, yet a deep melancholy remained over her.</p>

<p>At length Maria reported that Serenissimus had returned,
and once more a feverish unrest seized the Gr&auml;venitz. Would
he come to her? Would he summon her? The night drew
near, and no word came from the palace. The Landhofmeisterin's
fears reawoke. She paced restlessly up and down
the Favorite terrace whence she could see his Highness's
windows. The lights were lit. She watched; gradually the
palace grew dark. It was as though the light of her youth
was extinguished when his Highness's windows grew black.
She waited; perchance he would come yet? A terrible weariness
fell on her. The night was very beautiful, moonlit
and enchanted; the scent of the lilac smote heavy on the air&mdash;the
lilac and the red thorn blossom&mdash;&mdash; How beautiful it
was, how still, how divinely young it all seemed; and she was
old, old and weary, and forsaken and unutterably sad!</p>

<p>'Your Excellency must rest; come, dear Madame!' It was
Maria, the faithful friend, the only one who had not profited
by her mistress's vast power; she alone who had never
sought gain.</p>

<p>'Maria, I am too weary to sleep, and I dream so cruelly,'
the Gr&auml;venitz said sadly.</p>

<p>'Come and rest, and I will sit beside you all night,' the good
soul replied; and indeed, it seemed as though her honesty had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[<a href="./images/310.png">310</a>]</span>
driven away the Dream Demon, for the great Landhofmeisterin
slept like a tired child watched over by this faithful peasant
woman.</p>

<p>The next day the Gr&auml;venitz was utterly deserted. No word
came from the palace, no Secret Service officers came to report
to her, no courtiers thronged the antehall. It was Sunday,
and the bells of the palace chapel rang. Maria had heard
that Serenissimus had intimated his intention of attending
church twice that Sunday. The Landhofmeisterin<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single apostrophe">'s</ins> thoughts
followed him wistfully. Would he sit in his accustomed chair
in the gilded pew? Would his eyes wander to the sculptured
figures in the chapel, the figures which bore her features?
Would he remember how often she had sung to that organ?
Alas! Change is Death, and more cruel than Death.</p>

<p>The day passed, and still came no sign from Serenissimus.
Then the Landhofmeisterin sent Maria to the town to gather
news, and the maid returned and told her that it was rumoured
his Highness would start on the following morning to attend
the grand military review at Berlin. She had met one of the
palace grooms, and he had said that the horses were to be
in readiness soon after dawn. Good God! was Eberhard
Ludwig taking this way in order to rid himself of her? It
was entirely contrary to etiquette to hurry on a visiting
monarch's heels in this manner.</p>

<p>Her pride was swallowed up in gnawing anxiety. She
wrote to Eberhard Ludwig.</p>

<p>'Love has its rights, you cannot leave me without a word.
What have I done? how have I offended you? you, for whom
I would give my life! I ask nothing. If you have ceased to
love me, then banish me, imprison me, all you will, but come
to me once&mdash;once only. O beloved! remember the past; come
to me and tell me the truth. Tell me to go, and you need
never see my face again,' she wrote.</p>

<p>No letter came in answer; only a verbal message, delivered
by a sullen court lackey, that his Highness would visit her
Excellency ere he rode to Berlin. Her Excellency was to
expect him in the early morning, as he commenced his journey
betimes, owing to the long distance.</p>

<p>Another night of fierce unrest. Early she rose and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>
an elaborate toilet. She dressed in yellow, the colour he loved;
her hair was freshly powdered, her face carefully painted.</p>

<p>The dew glistened on the close-cropped grass of the gardens,
the lilacs were more radiant than ever, the birds in the chestnut-trees
sang their spring melody&mdash;the chant of nest-building, the
mating song.</p>

<p>Eberhard Ludwig rode up the avenue of La Favorite, and
dismounted before the terrace steps. His attendant took his
horse, and walked the beautiful animal up and down in the
shade of the chestnut-trees.</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin received Serenissimus in her yellow-hung
sitting-room. He was cold and distant, and she was
formal and restrained.</p>

<p>'I hope your Highness is in good health?' and 'your Excellency
appears to be mighty well!' Then the ice broke, and
she held out her arms to him.</p>

<p>'My beloved! my beloved! Ah! to see you again&mdash;&mdash;' But
he drew back.</p>

<p>'Madame, life is hard. We must part, you and I.'</p>

<p>'Oh no, no, not that! Tell me what has changed you? I
have been true always,' and she clung to him.</p>

<p>'I must alter everything&mdash;sinon je suis perdu!' Always
that phrase of his, he had called himself so often 'perdu!'</p>

<p>'Alter everything? Yes, yes; all you will. See, I am ready
to change, to obey in all things, dismiss any person who displeases
you; make some one else Landhofmeisterin, only keep
me, do not banish me; you are my life, only you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I must leave you; you have brought a curse upon the
land&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have brought a curse to you? If you leave me there
will be a curse&mdash;the eternal condemnation, brought by a
broken heart. Eberhard, my beloved! See&mdash;I implore
you!'</p>

<p>'I must go&mdash;I must leave you&mdash;sinon je suis perdu&mdash;sinon
je suis perdu,'&mdash;and so they wrangled, and exclaimed, and
implored for an hour.</p>

<p>'Your last word then is: Go, woman who has loved me for
twenty years!' she said bitterly at last. 'Yes? Well, then, hear
me: I will not go!&mdash;never, do you hear? We belong together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>
you and I. All this is some madness of yours, which will
pass. Come back to me to-morrow and tell me so, then all
will be well. It is well, do you hear? You are maddened,
distraught&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'This is my last word: Retire to one of your castles. I
leave you your properties and your title, but Ludwigsburg
must see you no more.'</p>

<p>She laughed in defiance. 'I will not go till you drive me
forth at the point of the bayonet. Your friend, the King of
Prussia, can teach you bayonet drill, and you can practise it
on my heart.'</p>

<p>Then he rode away from La Favorite, his horse's hoofs
outraging the peaceful dew.</p>

<hr />

<p>Directly Serenissimus had ridden away, as if in defiance of
impending fate, the Landhofmeisterin sent to summon the
officers of the Secret Service. She would work, give commands,
according to her wont. The officers tarried, and her
Excellency waited in her yellow-hung salon. Would they
dare, the creeping spies&mdash;dare to disobey her? she wondered.
She passed out on to the terrace and glanced down the
chestnut avenue. With a feeling of relief she recognised one
of the Secret Service officers. He was hurrying to La
Favorite as fast as, in other days, they and all the world had
hastened to do her bidding.</p>

<p>She re-entered her sitting-room and, seating herself at her
bureau, began to draft a ducal manifesto. The door opened,
and, to her surprise, not the Secret Service officer whom she
had thought to recognise, but a very inferior official, a mere
spy, entered. He walked in without removing his hat, and
came close up to the Gr&auml;venitz.</p>

<p>'What will you give me for my information?' he said
roughly.</p>

<p>'What do you mean? You have come to report, I suppose;
though why my chief officer, Jacoble, sends you, I do not
know,' she returned haughtily. He leaned his hand on the
bureau beside her.</p>

<p>'I have information which may save your life, but you
must pay me for it.' She rang her handbell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[<a href="./images/313.png">313</a>]</span>
'My lackeys will show you how I pay the insolent,' she
said.</p>

<p>'Your lackeys! There will not be one left in your house in
an hour's time,' he sneered.</p>

<p>Her face had grown ashen grey; even through her paint the
death-like colour showed.</p>

<p>'What are you saying?' she cried hoarsely. 'Here, take
my purse, all you will&mdash;but tell me quickly&mdash;quick, man,
tell me!'</p>

<p>At the sight of the heavy golden purse the spy's face and
manner changed. 'Serenissimus fell fainting from his horse
in the village of Marbach. They cannot rouse him; the doctors
say he will never awaken. They carry him to Ludwigsburg
to die. No one has remembered you yet, but when they
do&mdash;&mdash;!' he flung out his arm in a crushing gesture.</p>

<p>'When they do, they will imprison me till orders come
from the new Duke, you mean? Do you think I care? My
place is beside Serenissimus, and I go to the palace immediately.
Go, take the gulden and go.'</p>

<p>She swept from the room, and the spy saw her descending
the steps from the terrace to the garden. Her calm dignity
had disconcerted him, and, after all, he feared the Gr&auml;venitzin.</p>

<p>He turned to the bureau; at least, he would look through
her papers. But even in her distress the Landhofmeisterin
had remembered to shut and lock her bureau; and though the
spy tried to wrench it open, her Excellency's secrets were
guarded by intricate springs, and the man's efforts were
unavailing.</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin walked swiftly down the shady
avenue, and into the palace gardens. She had not passed
that way since her departure from Ludwigsburg, ten days
earlier. Her sharp eyes took in various neglected details.
'If he dies, and I go, the whole place will fall to ruin,' she
murmured.</p>

<p>Great commotion reigned in the castle. She could see that
even the sentries were discussing the Duke's health with a
crowd of Ludwigsburg burghers. They started when they saw
the Landhofmeisterin pass through the courtyard. Involuntarily
they fell back into their correct attitudes, and left the crowd's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[<a href="./images/314.png">314</a>]</span>
questions unanswered. The Gr&auml;venitz hurried to the Corps
de Logis, but the doors were closed, as had been those on the
north terrace facing La Favorite.</p>

<p>'The doors are locked from inside, Excellency,' said the
soldier on guard. 'Count Gr&auml;venitz commanded it.'</p>

<p>'So, is my brother within?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame; and Baron Sch&uuml;tz, Baron Roeder, and the
court physicians.'</p>

<p>They had locked her out, then. Ah! but she had her key of
the west pavilion, and the key of the doors leading to his Highness's
writing-room. She went to her former dwelling-place;
there stood no sentry now before her Excellency's pavilion.
The windows were closed and shuttered, and when she entered
a chill air met her. She shivered; the gay, bright pavilion
was like a tomb, the grave of happy hours, she thought. Her
upstair rooms were dark and desolate. Once more she realised
that she, her power, her glory, were dead things, and she
bowed before the inexorable law, Change.</p>

<p>She passed through the statue gallery and into the arras
passage. A deathlike silence reigned in his Highness's apartments.
O God! would she find a still, white figure&mdash;a rigid,
sheet-covered shape? She pushed open the tapestry door; the
writing-closet was empty, but beyond, in the sleeping-room,
she heard whispering voices.</p>

<p>The Duke lay on his bed fully dressed in his riding-clothes.
His left arm was held by the second physician, while the
chief surgeon bent over it, lancet in hand. A third doctor
kneeled, holding a bowl under his Highness's arm, from which
large drops of blood welled slowly, and fell with a sickening
soft thud into the china bowl.</p>

<p>Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz, Sch&uuml;tz, and Roeder stood near the
window, talking together in low tones. They started forward
when the Landhofmeisterin appeared on the threshold, and
Gr&auml;venitz approached her with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine, you must not come here now,' he said in an
ungentle voice.</p>

<p>'It is my place! let me pass,' she returned; and, waving
her brother away, she moved swiftly round to the other side
of the bed. She knelt down close to the Duke, and taking his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[<a href="./images/315.png">315</a>]</span>
right hand she raised it gently to her lips. The sufferer
moved slightly for the first time since he had fallen fainting
from his horse.</p>

<p>'Stem the blood, he is returning to consciousness,' whispered
the chief surgeon; and the first physician twisted a linen band
above the open vein, while the second doctor stanched the
blood with a cloth, and then bound up the wound.</p>

<p>'His Highness must have entire quiet, Madame,' the court
doctor said, bowing respectfully to the Landhofmeisterin. 'It
were well if all retired and left him to my care alone, if you
will permit me.'</p>

<p>'As Prime Minister, I consider it my duty to remain&mdash;&mdash;'
began Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz in a louder tone.</p>

<p>'As chief physician, I consider it my duty to order you to
retire! Madame, will you assist me in this matter?' he said
quietly to the Gr&auml;venitz.</p>

<p>'I will assist you, Herr Medicinalrath, by retiring myself.
I am sure the gentlemen will do likewise. Count Gr&auml;venitz,
I hold the first court charge, and I command you to depart.'
It was true; at Ludwigsburg the Landhofmeisterin was entitled
to command even the ministers, by reason of her high official
capacity. She rose from her knees and looked yearningly at
the lover of her youth.</p>

<p>'Will Serenissimus recover?' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Without a doubt now, your Excellency,' returned the
physician.</p>

<p>She was passing out when her eye caught sight of the red-stained
cloth with which they had stanched the blood from
Eberhard Ludwig's arm. Tenderly she lifted it; it seemed to
her that it was heavy with her beloved's lifeblood&mdash;a precious
relic. She carried it away through the quiet, sunlit gardens.
It was partly a despairing woman's whim, an absurdity, and
partly she was prompted by her magic practices to take the
cloth. There was an infallible life elixir and a powerful love
potion, one of whose ingredients was the blood of the loved
one. She would brew this mixture, Eberhard Ludwig should
drink it, then the old happiness would return. He would be
strong and well again, and with health would come love and
happiness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[<a href="./images/316.png">316</a>]</span>
The Gr&auml;venitz's witch practices had long been an eyesore
to his Highness. In the first place, he feared magic
exceedingly, and knowing the Landhofmeisterin's extraordinary
magnetic power, he believed entirely in her witchcraft.
Friedrich Wilhelm had thoroughly alarmed his Highness;
doubtless a curse rested on him for his sin. Surely,
thus to harbour an avowed witch would inevitably draw
down the wrath of God, and 'we princes must make personal
sacrifices for State reasons.' Then too Eberhard Ludwig,
having ceased to love the Gr&auml;venitz, was in a propitious
mood for returning to duty.</p>

<p>When the Duke regained consciousness he found himself
with the kindly court physician, who told him of the
Landhofmeisterin's visit, and of how it had been her touch
on his hand which had first roused him from his swoon.
The good man prated amiably to his Highness, thinking to
please him, but the Duke's face grew dark. The physician
had seen her Excellency's care of his Highness during his
illness in the preceding autumn, and had been deeply
impressed by her charm which she had chosen to exercise
upon him.</p>

<p>At this moment the Duke's valets entered to remove the
blood-filled bowl and the cloth used to stanch the blood,
these having been left by the physician's orders, as it was
imperative for Serenissimus to be undisturbed till he regained
entire consciousness. The lackeys searched for the cloth,
and not finding it, inquired if the physician had removed it.
Baron Roeder, who was waiting in his Highness's writing-closet,
heard the question through the open door. He tiptoed
to the threshold and informed the physician that her
Excellency the Landhofmeisterin had carried away the cloth.
His Highness heard, and, starting up, commanded Roeder to
bring it back forthwith.</p>

<p>'But, your Highness, her Excellency has carried it to La
Favorite,' said the astonished courtier.</p>

<p>'You are to fetch it and bring it here! I tell you to go.
If her Excellency will not give it, take it by force&mdash;by
force, do you hear? Here is my signet-ring, show her that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[<a href="./images/317.png">317</a>]</span>
Take a company of guards with you&mdash;but bring me back that
cloth!'</p>

<p>The Duke was beside himself; he was weak from loss of
blood, and he had worked himself into a frenzy of fear.
Suddenly the woman he had loved for twenty years had
become, to his thinking, a dangerous, threatening witch; she
who had lain on his breast, his mistress, the woman who
had tended him in illness, the hallowed being he had well-nigh
worshipped&mdash;offering up his country, his wife, his son,
all things at her shrine&mdash;now appeared before him as the
incarnation of evil to be compelled by a company of guards.</p>

<p>In vain the physician essayed to calm his Highness; he was
as one distraught, raving frantically of the missing cloth, of
spells and incantations.</p>

<hr />

<p>Roeder, arriving at La Favorite, stationed his guards carefully.
As a fact, the gentleman was terribly alarmed. It
was no pleasantry to affront the wrath of the Gr&auml;venitz.
Was she not a tyrant? and tyrants had strange ways of
hanging on to power after actual favour was gone past. And
was she not a witch? it was not reassuring to incur a
witch's curse. Nay, but she was a fallen favourite, the vile
amputated canker of a terrible epoch, harmless now the
blister of her evil glory was pricked, and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Politely he requested the Landhofmeisterin to deliver up
the missing cloth, but she denied possessing it; he insisted,
threatened to call the guard, and the whole house should be
searched; he had his Highness's warrant. He showed
her the Duke's signet-ring. She raged at him, dared him
to oppose her, menaced him. Then, changing her tone, she
cajoled him: if she indeed had the cloth, it would be easy
for him to retract his statement concerning having seen her
purloin it. Then she would be a friend to him; did he forget
her power? He questioned her on the uses she would make
of a blood-stained linen rag. She told him she had her
purposes, and he remembered her witch practices, the stories
of the ghastly ingredients of her magic potions. He alluded to
witchcraft, and she defied him again, then he called the guard;
but when the soldiers' tread echoed in the corridor, she drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[<a href="./images/318.png">318</a>]</span>
the cloth from a hidden panel in her bureau and flung it
at him, with bitter words cursing him. And he departed
trembling, the fear of the Gr&auml;venitz upon him.</p>

<p>Of course this was repeated in high colours to Serenissimus,
and his superstitious terror deepened. Then the valets
blabbed as to how Maria had often begged for locks of his
Highness's hair, for parings of his nails. More absurdities
for the magic love potions, very unappetising too. In a
violence of revolt against his once beloved, Eberhard Ludwig
signed an edict banishing the Landhofmeisterin from Ludwigsburg
and from Stuttgart. She could remain in Wirtemberg,
residing at any of her various castles; she should retain her
monies, and effects, and her rank; but all power, all part in
the country's government, was taken from her, and he would
see her face no more.</p>

<p>In a mighty virtuous frame of mind Serenissimus rode
away to Berlin, leaving this document to be enforced in his
absence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Gr&auml;venitz waited in a fever of anxiety at
La Favorite. On the day following his Highness's departure,
the document was presented to her by Sch&uuml;tz and several
officers of the law. She tore it across and across, and laughed
in their faces. And the solemn officials retired to communicate
with their Duke at Berlin concerning the further
treatment of this extraordinary woman. Wirtemberg was
much excited, for the news of her condemnation and of her
defiance spread through the country. For days she was
utterly alone with Maria and her personal domestics.</p>

<p>The Sittmann tribe found it necessary for its health to
retire to Teinach, a watering-place in the Black Forest; and
Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz remained secluded at Welzheim, the
manor his sister lent him, and which he chose to regard as
his own property. Ludwigsburg was like a city of the
dead; the Erbprincessin seldom left her apartments now;
day after day she sat brooding in deep melancholy. The
Erbprinz sometimes rode out from the palace, but he avoided
the direction of La Favorite. The Landhofmeisterin, deprived
of the company of the man she had loved during so many
years, deprived of her accustomed occupation of governing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[<a href="./images/319.png">319</a>]</span>
a country, used to the homage of courtiers and the blandishments
of parasites, sank into profound dejection.</p>

<p>After some two weeks the Landhofmeisterin heard the
thud of a cantering horse's hoofs nearing La Favorite. A
wild hope sprang up in her heart: it was Eberhard Ludwig,
of course; he had repented of his harshness, and was coming
to lead her back in loving triumph to Ludwigsburg.</p>

<p>The lackey announced that his Highness the Erbprinz
awaited her Excellency in the ballroom. Ah! not Serenissimus
then; but he had sent his son to tell her the good
news.</p>

<p>'Quick, Maria, a dash of rouge, a little powder. Is my hair
becomingly dressed? Give me my fan&mdash;yes! a rose at my
bosom. How do I look?' And the Gr&auml;venitz sallied down
to meet her beloved's son.</p>

<p>This was indeed a triumph. The Erbprinz had never visited
her at Favorite or Freudenthal. Everything was coming
right, of course&mdash;she had known it would!</p>

<p>'Good morning, Prince Friedrich, it is a great joy to me to
see you. Are you well? you look in good health.' It was
a very smiling, beautiful woman who spoke. Magnificent&mdash;a
trifle over-mature perchance; but a full-blown rose is a fine
thing, though some prefer the rosebud.</p>

<p>'I thank your Excellency; I am well, but I come on an
unpleasant mission&mdash;I regret&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Serenissimus is not ill, Monseigneur?' she cried.</p>

<p>'No, Madame; my father is in the enjoyment of health,
but&mdash;but&mdash;O Madame! believe me, I am loth to be the
bearer of such evil tidings to you, for you have always been
my friend.'</p>

<p>'Prince Friedrich, if I have been your friend, spare me
now; tell me without hesitation what your mission is. Alas!
I am indeed a stricken woman.'</p>

<p>In truth, her face was tragic. All the more terrible was this
menace to one who had dared to build such a structure of
hopefulness upon so slender a basis.</p>

<p>'Madame, my father bids me give you this letter. If you
do not obey immediately, I am to enforce these commands. I
pray you spare me that, dear, dear Madame!' He took her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[<a href="./images/320.png">320</a>]</span>
hand in his and kissed it; he was a very tender-hearted, an
easily subjugated little grand seigneur.</p>

<p>'Madame la Comtesse de W&uuml;rben, Comtesse de Gr&auml;venitz,
Landhofmeisterin de Wirtemberg.&mdash;In view of a great change
impending in my dukedom, I command you to depart instantly
from my court of Ludwigsburg. You are at liberty
to reside at any of the castles you have obtained from me,
but I forbid you to venture into my presence or to importune
the members either of my government or of my court. You
have refused obedience to my commands, delivered by my
Finance Minister, Baron Sch&uuml;tz, and by various high law officials.
I now make known to you that such future defiance will be
punished as traitorous to me. Here is my warrant and signed
decree given at Berlin this 29th of May 1730, signed Eberhard
Ludwig, Dux Wirtembergis.'</p>

<p>The Landhofmeisterin read this letter once, then mechanically
she read it again. It was written by his Highness; no
secretary had been intrusted with this precious document.
It seemed to her an added cruelty that the well-known handwriting
should form these stern words&mdash;the graceful, elegant
writing which she had seen blazoning her lover's passionate,
poetic homage to her in words of love and promises of fidelity.
The Erbprinz stood silent with bowed head. What would
she say, what would she do, this forceful woman? At length,
he raised his head and looked at her. She was still poring
over the Duke's letter as though its contents puzzled her.
The silence grew intolerable.</p>

<p>'Madame, believe me, I am truly grieved,' he began.</p>

<p>'Grieved? grieved? Ah! who would not be? This is an
outrage, a madness. What! can you believe that I can be
banished? I? Why, this whole world is of my making, this
Ludwigsburg. Go back and send a messenger to Berlin to
say that I will not go.' She spoke quietly, almost indifferently.</p>

<p>'Alas! Madame, if you have not left before sunset, I am
bound to have you removed by force,' he answered.</p>

<p>'You? My poor boy! You?&mdash;you remove me?' She
began to laugh.</p>

<p>'It may be ridiculous, Madame,' he said humbly, 'but such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[<a href="./images/321.png">321</a>]</span>
are my father's orders.' She laughed again. 'Come, Madame,
give me your answer. Believe me, I would spare you pain
but if you will not go, I am commanded to have you arrested
and conveyed to Hohenasperg.' Then the horror of it came
to the Landhofmeisterin.</p>

<p>'I to Hohenasperg? O God! God! that it should come
to this! Ah! the cruelty! But still I will fight to the last&mdash;I
will never go.' Her voice had risen to shrillness, her face
was contorted by anger; she looked incarnate rage, a Meg&aelig;ra.
Suddenly her features resumed their usual expression&mdash;nay,
more, it was the face of the grande charmeuse.</p>

<p>'Prince Friedrich, help me; this is only a passing mood of
your father's! Let me stay here till he returns from Berlin.
Use your power for my good; you are heir to all this splendour;
you will reap the harvest of beauty I have sown at Ludwigsburg.
Help me, and you will never regret it.' She had come
close to him, smiling into his eyes. The frail, sensitive youth
flushed scarlet.</p>

<p>'Prince, you are the image of your father as I knew him
twenty years ago. You bring my youth back to me.' She
laid her hand upon his shoulder and drew him towards her.
She was very beautiful for all her forty-five years, her
presence was intoxication.</p>

<p>'Friedrich, Friedrich, you could revenge so much&mdash;so much
neglect, if you were my friend.' Her lips were very near to
his, her breath was on his cheek. Like most super-sensitive
beings, he was vividly passionate; and she knew it, and this
was her last card: to make him love her, aid her to stay at
Favorite, then, when Eberhard Ludwig returned, surely jealousy
would recall love. It was a dangerous game enough, but it
was her last resource.</p>

<p>'Little Friedrich, who makes me feel young again,' she
murmured. Now her lips are on his&mdash;and the room swings
round him&mdash;while the scent of the fading lilacs in the garden
is wafted in with delicious, heavy, unwholesome sweetness.
And she herself, caught by an eddy of her feigned passion,
is swept into a wave of sensual recollection. She is in the
Rothenwald again on a spring morning&mdash;overhead a bird sings
a rhapsody&mdash;and she&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[<a href="./images/322.png">322</a>]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>With a cry the Prince sprang away from her.</p>

<p>'Madame! O Madame! you tempt me from my duty; you
must go from here. Indeed, I cannot help you, but I will
not let the guards disturb you, till to-morrow. I pray you,
Madame, go this day.'</p>

<p>'Never; you do not know me! I will never go. Use force
if you will&mdash;but I stay at Ludwigsburg.'</p>

<p>The Erbprinz turned away sorrowfully.</p>

<p>'Then I cannot help you.' He took her hand and raised it
to his lips. 'Farewell, Madame,' he whispered. Did his lips
linger on her hand a little longer than custom dictated? She
thought so, and smiled to herself as Prince Friedrich left her.</p>

<p>Hardly had the Erbprinz departed when she heard the sound
of approaching wheels in the avenue. 'I am receiving many
visitors to-day,' she thought bitterly. To her surprise Monseigneur
de Zollern was announced. He greeted the Landhofmeisterin
warmly, though gravely, and immediately commenced
questioning her on her position. She told him the details of
the foregoing weeks. Zollern listened attentively, with his
hands crossed as usual over the porcelain handle of his stick.
He had grown terribly old in spite of his straight and dapper
figure, and his face was like ancient parchment; only the
bright, restless eyes seemed eagerly alive.</p>

<p>He told the Landhofmeisterin that the news of her misfortune
had reached him, and that he had come to counsel her
immediate retreat. He argued with her gently, but she was
obdurate; go she would not. Then the old man begged her
to depart; he prayed her, by Madame de Ruth's memory, to
be reasonable.</p>

<p>'Consider, Madame,' he said, 'I am a very old man&mdash;yes, yes,
old and broken&mdash;and I have travelled far to save you from
your own obstinacy, for you are dear to me; you are my one
remaining link with the past, with my past youth. You were
Madame de Ruth's friend, and I cherish you as that. Yes;
she was the love of my life&mdash;I may say it now, for it is ancient
history&mdash;and she loved you. Would she not have counselled
prudence? Fly now, that you may return later.'</p>

<p>At this moment a lackey brought a folded paper to the
Gr&auml;venitz.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[<a href="./images/323.png">323</a>]</span>
'Unknown to me, General Pruckdorff had received orders
from my father to expel you by force from Favorite and
Ludwigsburg if you have not left by six of the clock this
evening. I pray you, Madame, fly! I shall never forget you.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Friedrich
Ludwig</span>, Erbprinz.'</p>

<p>Without a word the Landhofmeisterin handed the paper to
Zollern.</p>

<p>'Ah! a charming invitation!' he said loudly, so that the
lackey who stood waiting could not fail to hear. 'I should
advise you to accept. A most entertaining f&ecirc;te. Order your
carosse, dear Madame.'</p>

<p>Calmly the Landhofmeisterin gave the necessary commands
for her coach and outriders, and summoning Maria she bade
her collect some few objects of value and various papers.
Then she took leave of Zollern.</p>

<p>'Au revoir, Monseigneur,' she said.</p>

<p>'Adieu, Madame; this is the last act of the comedy called
the Great Intrigue,' he answered.</p>

<hr />

<p>Yet she tarried till the last moment at La Favorite. It
was a terrible leave-taking. She wandered round her pretty
rooms, looking her last at the graceful devices, the slender
traceries on wall and ceiling, at the things she had loved&mdash;the
beautiful porcelains, the delicate, brocaded hangings. Then
she passed out on to the terrace. What a wondrous summer
evening it was! The sun was sinking low in the west&mdash;when
the last ray had vanished the soldiers would come to drag
her away. It was time, she must hasten&mdash;and yet she
lingered. She leaned on the balustrade and contemplated
the palace. Her thoughts travelled back to the days when
Ludwigsburg was still a-building, and she and Eberhard
Ludwig had planned the gardens together.</p>

<p>'Here should be a parterre of roses,' she had said.</p>

<p>'Nay, jasmine and heliotrope here; the roses must be beneath
your window to sigh out their souls before your shrine,' he
had answered.</p>

<p>Could it be ended? The habit of years was too strong, she
could not realise. She listened to the summer sounds in the
garden: the rustle of the gentle breeze in the chestnut-trees,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[<a href="./images/324.png">324</a>]</span>
the chirping of the grasshoppers, the bees droning over the
flowers. Spring was past, it was summer. 'Ah! winter for
me; winter and sadness for ever now,' she moaned. The sun
was sinking&mdash;she must fly. 'Farewell happiness!' she murmured,
and with bent head she passed down the terrace steps
and entered her coach.</p>

<p>As she drove down the avenue she heard a bugle ring out
from the Ludwigsburg casern.</p>

<p>'Ride faster, hasten to Freudenthal!' she called to her
postillions, and at a gallop the Landhofmeisterin's coach
thundered away westwards to the distant line of hills where
lay Freudenthal. Once she turned as she passed through the
Ludwigsburg gates. She turned and saw the great roofs of the
palace which had been reared for her, and whence she was
henceforward banished for ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Freudenthal</span> was full of ghosts for the Gr&auml;venitz: Madame
de Ruth, her dead friend; Zollern, who had bade her farewell
for ever; and Eberhard Ludwig, the unfaithful lover of her
vanished youth. She walked in the gardens, listening involuntarily
for the voice which had so often called 'Philom&egrave;le
beloved' from the orchard gate. There was no consolation on
earth for her, she knew that; all she had loved, all she had
achieved, her power, her great honours, were dead things.
The forced inaction of her future tortured her. How would
she pass the long dreary hours of the rest of her life? True,
the Jewish community of Freudenthal had greeted her with
enthusiasm; they were faithful, these despised Israelites. For
a moment it had warmed her heart back to a little interest in
living. She busied herself with the affairs of the village, but
she was used to a press of work, of governing, of vital interests;
how could these minor matters occupy her for long?</p>

<p>She tried to read, but though her eyes followed the lines
her thoughts flashed away to Ludwigsburg. She struck a few
chords on the spinet; unconsciously her fingers glided into a
melody Eberhard Ludwig had loved, and only a sob broke
from her lips when she would have sung. Ghosts at Freudenthal?
She was the ghost herself; she was the shadow of
bygone days&mdash;the poor, yearning, broken-hearted ghost.</p>

<p>They came and told her that Serenissimus had returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[<a href="./images/326.png">326</a>]</span>
from Berlin, and that he had been greeted by the news of the
Erbprinz's serious illness. Prince Friedrich had fallen ill of
a nervous fever, they said. Ah, yes! she told herself she
had caused it; in her morbid sadness she took the blame of
every untoward occurrence upon her shoulders. She had
caused Friedrich Ludwig to fall ill, for great emotions must
perforce shatter so frail a being as he was, and she had
tortured him, tempted him.</p>

<p>One day two travelling coaches rolled into Freudenthal&mdash;the
Sittmann tribe arrived. It was but ill received by the
Gr&auml;venitz. Why had they come? she asked. Her sister
informed her that Serenissimus had broken up the court of
Ludwigsburg; he was to reside henceforth at Stuttgart. Had
she not heard? Oh, yes! His Highness was reconciled with
the Duchess, and it was disagreeable for former members of
the Ludwigsburg court nowadays. This latter was said in a
whiny tone of reproach.</p>

<p>'Get you gone to your own apartments, my sister and my
sister's brats! If stay you must at Freudenthal, then stay,
but leave me now,' the Gr&auml;venitz said; and though she was no
longer the all-powerful Landhofmeisterin, still there was that
about her which made the parasites shrink back. But they had
done enough, had they not? in telling her thus roughly that
the woman she had loathed and despised with all jealousy's
venom during twenty years, had triumphed over her at last.</p>

<p>The Gr&auml;venitz stood before one of the most galling of life's
lessons, she had to bow to the inexorable commonplace. Her
whole being was agonised; she was breasting the dark waters
of despair, she was living a tragedy, but everyday life had to
go on as usual: the necessary routine of it, the dressing, the
eating, the lying down to rest at night. She heard the village
children singing on their way home from school, and the
harvesters driving merrily to the fields. Sometimes she would
cry out in protest against Nature, against the unalterable,
indifferent working of the universe: the smiling sun, the
peace of summer evenings. All things went their way heedless
of her tragedy.</p>

<p>Summer blossomed gloriously; then the long, weary days
grew shorter, and autumn brought endless nights to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[<a href="./images/327.png">327</a>]</span>
stricken woman. Once, twice she had written to Serenissimus,
but no answer came to her.</p>

<p>The Erbprinz still battled with death. Eberhard Ludwig
and Johanna Elizabetha watched together at his bedside, and
the Erbprincessin sat stonily silent in the darkened room
whose gloom seemed deepened by the poor girl's overshadowed
mind.</p>

<p>Then in October came the news that Death had conquered;
the Erbprinz had passed away, and the Erbprincessin, half-mad
already, had fallen into such despair that her clouded
soul grew utterly black, and she raved in hopeless insanity.
Truly God's hand was heavy upon Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>A few days after this terrible news the Gr&auml;venitz, wandering
moodily in the Freudenthal garden, heard the rattle of
an approaching troop of horse. He was coming to fetch her,
of course&mdash;her lover, her trusted one. She had known he must
come! And she hurried away to her tiring-room to don her
finest raiment. She would meet him like a bride. Was it
not fitting that she should be gorgeously attired on this great
day of triumph&mdash;this renascence of joy in her life?</p>

<p>The gown of golden cloth lay spread out for her; she always
kept it ready, for she knew he would come.</p>

<p>'Quick, Maria,' she called, as with trembling hands she
began her toilet; 'quick! His Highness comes!' She seemed
young again, with flushed cheeks and shining eyes. Then her
sister Sittmann burst into the room.</p>

<p>'Wilhelmine, I hardly know how to tell you&mdash;it is&mdash;&mdash;' she
said, but the Gr&auml;venitz interrupted her.</p>

<p>'You need not&mdash;for I know&mdash;I always knew.' She stood
before the mirror fastening a diamond ornament into her
hair, and her glowing eyes met her sister's reflected in the
glass.</p>

<p>'Good lack, sister! what ails you?' she cried, for the
Sittmann's face was ashen, and she gazed at the Gr&auml;venitz
in terrified bewilderment.</p>

<p>'Who do you think has come, then? Wilhelmine, you are
mad! It is a troop of horse, headed by Roeder, with a warrant
for your arrest.'</p>

<p>The diamonds slipped from the Gr&auml;venitz's fingers, and fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[<a href="./images/328.png">328</a>]</span>
unheeded on the floor, while all the glow and youth faded
from her face.</p>

<p>'What are you saying? It is you who are mad&mdash;I know&mdash;it
is his Highness,' she stammered hoarsely, seemingly incapable
of comprehending the meaning of her sister's words.
Suddenly her vigour returned, her courage, and that perfect
grip of startling events which had stood her in good stead for
many years.</p>

<p>'Where are they? Maria, bolt all the doors&mdash;quick, girl!
In the court, you say? Tell them I am in the garden, send
them round, then shut and bar each window.' She gave her
orders clearly and calmly, like some general, the practised
commander in a hundred sieges. By this time all the inmates
of Freudenthal had gathered at the door of her apartment:
Baron Sittmann and his sons, the brothers Pfau, a horde of
serving men and women. Once more the Gr&auml;venitz seemed
to be the great Landhofmeisterin whose lightest word was law,
and they did her bidding without question or comment.</p>

<p>'Back, all of you, I will speak with Baron Roeder.' She
moved to her bedchamber window which looked upon the
garden. Below, on the terrace, stood Roeder and another
officer consulting together in low tones, while through the
garden tramped the soldiers, seeking her whom they had
treated with royal honours for twenty years. She flung open
the window and stood before the two officers.</p>

<p>'Monsieur le Baron Roeder,' she said slowly, 'to what do I
owe the pleasure of your visit? I am rejoiced to see you;
but kindly desire your men to spare my garden&mdash;they are
ruining my flowers.'</p>

<p>Roeder looked dumbfounded.</p>

<p>'Certainly, your Excellency,' he stammered, 'but I must
crave a word with you immediately.'</p>

<p>'I regret, Monsieur, that illness confines me to my room.
I cannot receive you. Tell me your business from where
you are.' She spoke mockingly, looking down at the man
below.</p>

<p>'Impossible! Madame, I must speak with you face to face,'
he said angrily; and indeed it was an absurd situation.</p>

<p>'We are face to face, Monsieur de Roeder, and I pray you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[<a href="./images/329.png">329</a>]</span>
tell me your mission without delay. I am fatigued with
standing so long. Come, I am not in the habit of waiting,
Monsieur.'</p>

<p>'Then, Madame, I arrest you in the Duke's name. You are
my prisoner, and if you will not come quietly, I shall be
obliged to use force,'&mdash;this with a gesture towards the soldiers,
who had formed into line behind him.</p>

<p>'I am Countess of the Empire, Landhofmeisterin of Wirtemberg,
and none but my superior can arrest me, Monsieur.
Also, this house of mine is on free territory, subject only to the
authority of the Emperor. I refuse to be arrested, I refuse to
give you admittance, and I command you to withdraw.' She
spoke perfectly calmly, with the tone given by the habit of
command, which she had wielded for nigh upon a quarter of
a century.</p>

<p>Roeder hesitated; what she said might be true, and he
greatly feared her, but he had his orders from the Duke. He
recalled his Highness's words when he had intrusted him
with the Gr&auml;venitz's arrest: 'I have not done enough. God's
vengeance is not fulfilled. The witch-woman, the Land-despoiler
is still at large in my country, and God has taken my only
son from me. I must purge my land of this sinner&mdash;punish
her&mdash;break her in atonement,' his Highness had said. The
Duke was firmly persuaded that so long as the Gr&auml;venitz
remained free, God's wrath would be on Wirtemberg, and the
notion was fostered by her enemies. No one spoke of her now
save as the 'Land-despoiler,' that name which the peasantry
had called her in secret for many years.</p>

<p>'Madame, give yourself up peaceably, or I shall force my
way in,' Roeder called to her; but she had gone from the
window, and the house was shuttered, and with closed doors.</p>

<p>Then began the work of breaking into the manor of Freudenthal.
Twenty soldiers hacked in the doors with axes,
while the rest stood sentry keeping the Jews at bay, for the
members of the Jewish settlement gathered round, eager to
protect their friend; but they were unarmed, and the inherited
submission of their oppressed race made them poor protectors.
The soldiers poured into the house. Roeder was received
before the Gr&auml;venitz's door by Madame de Sittmann. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[<a href="./images/330.png">330</a>]</span>
implored him to spare her sister, who, she assured him, was
really ill. The door leading from the Gr&auml;venitz's apartment
was bolted from within. He knocked loudly, but there being
no response, he summoned the soldiers to break it in.</p>

<p>With a crash the door yielded, falling inwards. And then
he saw his quarry. She stood in the middle of the room,
erect, vigorous, a very flame of hatred burning in her eyes.
She was clad in the golden gown which she had donned in
honour of joy's return; on her breast was the order of St.
Hubertus, and the jewels of Wirtemberg gleamed on her neck
and in her hair. Never had she looked more beautiful, more
magnificent than in this hour of her defeat, and even Roeder
stood silent and abashed before her.</p>

<p>'Well, Monsieur le Baron de Roeder,' she said, 'so you
have defied me again? See here, I curse you; you have
called me a witch, and you are cursed by me. It will not
bring you happiness.'</p>

<p>'It is my duty, Madame,' he replied steadily. Her face
changed.</p>

<p>'You are right, man; I grow petty in my old age. See, I
forgive you. Alas! my hour has struck.' She held out her
hands towards him. 'Do not bind my wrists, I will come.
It is useless to fight Fate. Ah, Roeder! Roeder! whither
are you dragging me?' Her potent charm was alive in every
word. After all, it was a greater weapon than curses; she knew
that, and used it now.</p>

<p>'I thank your Excellency for aiding me in my terrible
task,' said Roeder huskily. 'Is there anything in which I
may serve you before we start?'</p>

<p>'No, Monsieur, I am ready; only permit my maid Maria to
accompany me, and to bring such things as are necessary for
my comfort,' she said quietly.</p>

<p>'It is against his Highness's orders, Excellency,' he began;
but she smiled at him, la grande charmeuse, and as usual
she conquered.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sadly the cort&egrave;ge left Freudenthal. Only once did the
Gr&auml;venitz break down. As she passed the orchard gate where
Eberhard Ludwig had so often stood on summer evenings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[<a href="./images/331.png">331</a>]</span>
calling 'Philom&egrave;le beloved,' she bent her head, and, sobbing
bitterly, murmured: 'Change is Death.'</p>

<hr />

<p>The fortress of Hohenasperg stands about half a league from
Ludwigsburg. In the midst of rich orchards this gaunt rock
rises abruptly from the plain like some huge fist of a heathen
god, threatening the peace of the fruitful land with sombre
menace. From heathen days it was named Asperg, after the
Aasen or Germanic gods, whose sacred mountain it was.
Round this stronghold men fought for centuries: naked
barbarians against Roman legions; rebellious knights of old
against Imperial troops; Protestant generals against the
armies of the Holy Roman Empire; later, Wirtembergers
against the invading Frenchmen. Asperg, impregnable in war
time, was a prison in times of peace; from its dark walls
and giant ramparts escape was impossible for the prisoner.
The very name of Asperg was a terror, its shape was
awe-inspiring. And hither they brought Wilhelmine von
Gr&auml;venitz on that smiling October afternoon. Slowly her
coach rumbled up to the grim gate over which a sinister
lion's head frowns down at those who enter this stern prison.
The arms of Wirtemberg are emblazoned on each side of the
lion's head, surmounted by that ducal crown for which the
Gr&auml;venitz had made so audacious a struggle.</p>

<p>Her coach drew up before this gate and Roeder bade her
descend. Here his charge ended, he had conveyed the Land-despoiler
to durance vile. The governor of the prison met
his prisoner at the gate. A bluff-mannered Wirtemberger,
short of stature, red of visage, and with fiery little twinkling
eyes beneath heavy, bristling eyebrows. A fierce bull-dog
man he looked, but his appearance belied him; for he was a
tender-hearted gentleman, and received his prisoner with a
courteous consideration which many a polished courtier would
not have offered to the fallen tyrant. Up the steep, dark,
well-like road to the inner courtyard he led the Gr&auml;venitz,
followed by Maria, who wept bitterly.</p>

<p>'I have orders to lodge you safely, Excellency. Safe you
will be here, and I do not purpose to restrict your liberty
greatly,' he said as he ushered her into a small chamber with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>[<a href="./images/332.png">332</a>]</span>
a door leading on to the ramparts. Two sentries stood on either
side of the entrance to her apartment, but for the rest the room
was clean and pleasant, and commanded a fair view of the
plain beneath.</p>

<p>'I thank you, Monsieur, for your kindness,' she said,
approaching the barred window. Then she gave a little cry,
like to the moan of one wounded when a fresh agony is
inflicted.</p>

<p>'Give me a cell, Monsieur&mdash;a dungeon; only not that&mdash;not
that&mdash;if you have mercy in your heart!' she pointed tragically
through the window. In the dying sunlight lay the great
palace of Ludwigsburg, the rounded roofs, the terraces, and
the Ch&acirc;teau Joyeux of La Favorite in the midst of flowering
parterres.</p>

<p>'I regret, Madame, believe me. I regret infinitely, but I
have not another apartment to offer you. Do not look from
the window overmuch, Madame.' The old man's voice broke
and he put out his strong rough hand to draw her away from
the beautiful, peaceful view. But how inconsistent is the
human heart! She waved him away, and stood as though
rooted to the spot, her eyes fixed upon the scene of her passed
happiness.</p>

<hr />

<p>At first the tumult in her heart shut out the peace which
was silently waiting for admittance; the peace of seclusion
bringing those calm thoughts which wait upon the fevered
soul of man in Nature's vast aloofness. Gradually the beauty
of the fruitful plain with its cornfields and rich orchards, the
mystery of the far-off hills on the horizon, the poetry of the
distant, dark-blue line of the forests, the song of the wind
murmuring through those few trees which had sprung up on
the fortress terraces and ramparts unabashed by warfare;
gradually this peace came to the Gr&auml;venitz, and she grew
calm. True, she agonised when her eyes fell upon Ludwigsburg,
and she raged when the prison governor told her of the
march of events in Stuttgart; but still she knew a greater
peace, a more equable inner life than had been hers in the
day of her power.</p>

<p>A commission waited upon her, demanding the restitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[<a href="./images/333.png">333</a>]</span>
of the jewels of Wirtemberg. Some she had carried with her
to Hohenasperg, some had been already found at Freudenthal.
It cost her a pang to part with the jewels. Had not Eberhard
Ludwig given each one to her with a lover's vow, a passionate
word?</p>

<p>They demanded also that she should give up certain locks
of his Highness's hair which she had unlawfully retained for
purposes of detestable magic. She made answer that she had
but one strand of his hair in a diamond locket. She said that
she had worn this on her heart for twenty years. 'Is that
magic, Messieurs?' she asked. Had they known it, they had
indeed touched upon one of her sorceress secrets&mdash;the charm of a
woman who can love a man with undying poetry and romance.
They told her that she must give up this pathetic lock of hair,
that she retained it to brew love potions and such abominations.
They took it from her, leaving her the empty crystal
locket with its encircling diamonds.</p>

<p>'How you fear me, Messieurs!' she said with a flash of her
old defiance. Then they left her with her empty locket and
her empty life.</p>

<p>Yet her atonement was only beginning; 'the wages of sin
is death,' and worse than death a long-drawn agony of
humiliation and loneliness. Abasement, shame, defeat, fear,
inaction, loneliness, yearning&mdash;all these she had drunk in
her cup of suffering, but in the dregs there remained one more
drop of gall&mdash;jealousy.</p>

<p>Now, in the spring before she left Ludwigsburg, she had
been annoyed by a rumour which had caused much commotion
among the Wirtemberg peasants, and even the courtiers
had been infected with a wave of superstitious interest. In
the house of Wirtemberg there is a legend which tells how
Count Eberhard the Bearded, in humility and repentance
of his youthful sins, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem accompanied
by twenty-four noble youths bound by sacred vows to
purity and godly life. When Count Eberhard was praying
before the Holy Sepulchre, of a sudden a withered whitethorn-tree
quickened and blossomed in token of God's grace, and
a priest in Eberhard's following prophesied that so long as
the world lasted, this thorn-tree should flower whenever the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[<a href="./images/334.png">334</a>]</span>
noble race of Wirtemberg should bloom anew. Piously the
pilgrims bore the thorn-tree back to their native land, and set
it in a fair and sheltered spot near to the abode of a venerable
hermit. Here Count Eberhard instituted an order of prayerful
monks, garbed in fair blue habits, and for many generations
these holy men tended the thorn-tree, building giant supports
beneath its spreading roots and vigorous branches. In
Protestant days the poor thorn-tree was forgotten, save by the
peasants who clung to their old legends and vowed that, whenever
an heir was born to the house of Wirtemberg, the aged
thorn put forth a flowering branch.</p>

<p>It happened that, shortly before the Gr&auml;venitz was banished
from Ludwigsburg, Eberhard Ludwig, in the course of his
wood wanderings, came to Einsiedel where stood the ruined
monastery and the fateful thorn-tree. An old peasant
woman, who was gathering sticks for her fire in the deserted
monastery garden, told him of the legend, and, pointing
to the whitethorn, exclaimed: 'You who are a traveller, go to
the palace and tell the Duke that the thorn has blossomed.
Tell him to leave the wanton Land-despoiler, and go back to his
true wife. God has caused the thorn to bloom anew in token
of pardon, and there will be an heir born to Wirtemberg to
take the place of the dying Erbprinz.' Now the Erbprinz
was not dying when the old crone spoke these words, but
Eberhard Ludwig, always feverishly anxious for his son's welfare,
hurried back to Ludwigsburg in an agony of fear and
related the peasant woman's prophecy, and the strange fact
of that ancient thorn-tree putting forth a spray of white
blossom. Her Excellency the Landhofmeisterin had been
much offended by the story, and had mocked Serenissimus
for his credulity.</p>

<p>Of course when, shortly after this event, Eberhard Ludwig
repudiated his mistress and returned to his neglected Duchess,
popular report immediately had it that the whitethorn had
prophesied the happy occurrence, and that her Highness
Johanna Elizabetha was to become a mother. This the Gr&auml;venitz
had heard during her sojourn at Freudenthal, but it
was in November at Asperg that she heard the Duchess was
indeed with child. At first she vowed she did not believe it;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[<a href="./images/335.png">335</a>]</span>
it was an absurd story started by the believers in that ridiculous
thorn-tree; but when the fact of her Highness's pregnancy
could be doubted no longer, the Gr&auml;venitz fell into an agony
of jealousy. She paced her small room like some tortured
tigress; she cursed all men; she sobbed in a passion of anger.
Waking or sleeping the thought never left her. Her dreams
were for ever of Eberhard Ludwig and the woman she hated.
God, how she despised her! How she shuddered at the thought
of her motherhood. She told herself that it was disgust, and
even as she formulated the thought she knew that it was envy&mdash;cruel,
aching envy which tortured her. She was jealous,
then? She? The very supposition was an abasement. Could
she be jealous of that dull, heavy woman, with her reddened
eyes? But she would be the mother of his child. . . .</p>

<p>They told her that prayers for her Highness's safe delivery
were offered up in all the churches in Wirtemberg, and that
there was immense rejoicing in the land. There was no
doubt then, and the Gr&auml;venitz's dreams were unending of the
Duchess holding out a beautiful man-child to Eberhard
Ludwig, who smiled in happiness and peace.</p>

<p>At length one day in December Maria told her that there
were exciting rumours in the village which nestles at the base
of the fortress rock of Hohenasperg. The Duchess was sick
unto death, they said, and the doctors were entirely puzzled.
Into the Gr&auml;venitz's heart there crept a ray of hope. God
forgive her! she prayed for death to visit Stuttgart's castle.</p>

<p>Daily she sent Maria to the village to learn the news. One
day the governor came to her and told her he had a terrible
thing to communicate. Good, honest man, he often spent an
hour with his prisoner telling her news of the outer world.</p>

<p>'The Duchess has suffered a cruel disappointment, Madame,'
he said; 'all Wirtemberg will condole with her. Her hopes
are ended, the doctors have been mistaken, there will be no
heir to the Dukedom. Her Highness suffers from dropsy.
Great heavens! what ails you?' he cried, for the Gr&auml;venitz
had flung herself back into her chair, convulsed in a horrible
paroxysm of mirthless laughter.</p>

<hr />

<p>The plain below Hohenasperg was white with snow&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[<a href="./images/336.png">336</a>]</span>
light fall, which lay thinly on the even ground but had failed
to whiten the fortress rock, where only patches clung, emphasising
the sombre colour of the stone hill. The sky was leaden,
lowering, sinister, pregnant with unborn snow. A company
of horsemen took its way up the steep road leading from the
village of Asperg to the fortress. Following this cavalcade
was a coach drawn by four horses. The Gr&auml;venitz, standing
on the west terrace, watched the horsemen approach. She
wondered idly if another State prisoner was being conveyed
to Hohenasperg. She saw the leader of the troop parleying
with the sentry. He showed a document to the man; then
the outer gate swung back and the cavalcade was hidden from
her sight between the gloomy walls of the steep, dark lane
leading up to the second or inner gate. She turned away;
after all, these things were of no account to her. That was
one of her agonies; she to whom all things had mattered, the
much occupied, the ruler, the indefatigable administrator&mdash;she
was forced into lethargic quiescence. Every hour was empty
for her. She turned away listlessly. The afternoon was drawing
to a close. It would be a white world to-morrow, she reflected,
for those swollen clouds could not hold the snow longer.</p>

<p>The prison governor was coming along the terrace towards
her. She greeted him in friendly fashion; but at first he
spoke no word, only took both her hands in his.</p>

<p>'I have bad news, Madame,' he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>'Ah! tell me; I am used to sadness now. What is it? O
God! but it is not some accident to Serenissimus?' she said.
The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>'No, Madame, but you are to be removed from my care.
And I fear&mdash;&mdash;' he began.</p>

<p>'Death? Would he dare? After all, perhaps, it were
better,' she said calmly.</p>

<p>'No, not that; you are to be moved to Hohen-Urach. . . .
Madame, they will try you for your life. Alas! his Highness
believes you have cast a spell upon the Duchess and caused
her misfortune. Asperg is too close to Stuttgart.'</p>

<p>She smiled at him. 'It does not signify, dear friend. One
prison is like another, I suppose; but I shall miss my jailor!
Let me thank you, Monsieur, for your great courtesy to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[<a href="./images/337.png">337</a>]</span>
fallen Land-despoiler.' She spoke almost gaily, and the
governor turned away his head.</p>

<p>'I would help you, Excellency; pray God I may be able to
serve you one day,' he said huskily.</p>

<p>'Tell them I shall start to-morrow, when the snowstorm
is over. I shall be prepared.'</p>

<p>'I regret&mdash;Excellency&mdash;In truth, I scarce know how to
tell you&mdash;It is ordered that you shall travel to-day&mdash;immediately,'
he said.</p>

<p>'A prisoner has no choice, Monsieur,' she answered bitterly.</p>

<hr />

<p>As the cort&egrave;ge passed out of the Hohenasperg gate, the
first snowflakes fell, and when they reached the village at the
foot of the hill there was a whirling storm.</p>

<p>The journey to Urach through the snow was terrible. For
hours the cavalcade wandered in the snowdrifts between
N&uuml;rtingen and Urach, and when at length the unhappy woman
was housed for a few hours' rest in a village inn, her slumber
was broken by the sounds of rude merriment in the hall below
her sleeping-room, where the peasants were dancing. She was
wont to say afterwards that this trivial episode had been one
of her most painful experiences. Her nerves were on the
rack, for she expected that some cruel trial awaited her at
Urach. She was terribly weary from the long hours of
wandering, and from cold and exposure; her pride had been
galled by the gaping, laughing, jeering, mocking crowd of
peasants which had stood round her while the captain of the
guard made arrangements for her night's lodging. Then her
sensitive ear was tortured by the peasants' music, which beat
on and on in monotonous, inharmonious measure all through
the night.</p>

<p>If suffering is atonement for sin, certain it is that the
Gr&auml;venitz agonised at Urach. Her imprisonment was infinitely
more rigorous than it had been at Hohenasperg. The
governor treated her with scant consideration, and answered
her questions shortly. He forbade the faithful Maria either
to go to the town or to speak with the other inhabitants of
the fortress prison. Thus the Gr&auml;venitz had no knowledge
of the doings in the world. She tasted real imprisonment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[<a href="./images/338.png">338</a>]</span>
the torture of being entirely cut off from human interests.
Also she was left in ignorance of her future. Death,
banishment, perpetual imprisonment? She knew nothing.
She penned passionate appeals to his Highness, but the
governor informed her that he could forward no writings
from a prisoner awaiting trial.</p>

<p>'When shall I be tried, and for what offences?' she demanded.</p>

<p>'I am not at liberty to say,' he returned, and left her.</p>

<p>She fell ill, or feigned to do so, and when the apothecary
tended her she offered him vast sums if he would tell her
what had occurred in Stuttgart. The man reported this to
the prison governor, who further restricted the Gr&auml;venitz's
liberty in punishment. She was no longer permitted to walk
on the ramparts. She grew really ill after this. For many
days she lay upon the rude pallet, which was called bed at
Urach, and, turning her face to the wall, refused to take
nourishment. Maria, in an agony of fear, sought the governor
and told him her Excellency lay dying.</p>

<p>'A very curious coincidence,' said the governor musingly.</p>

<p>'How, sir? I do not understand,' inquired Maria.</p>

<p>'It is said that his Highness lies dying also; there can be
no harm in telling you that,' replied the cautious official. Maria,
burdened with her sorrowful secret, returned to watch over
her beloved mistress. For weeks the Gr&auml;venitz pined in
hopeless sadness and physical illness, then her old spirit
returned, and she faced life again. Maria had not told her
that Serenissimus was sick unto death, dead perhaps by this
time; she knew not, for none at Hohen-Urach would answer
the witch's serving-maid.</p>

<p>Spring came, and the Gr&auml;venitz petitioned the prison
governor to permit her to walk on the ramparts as before.
Unwillingly the man acceded to her request, and once more
she was at liberty to breathe the air of heaven, and to feast
her eyes upon the majestic view of the hill-country. But
there was pain for her, even in this her one enjoyment, for
from the rampart she looked down upon that little hill-town
of Urach which had seen her in the heyday of her youth and
love. She could even see the windows of the Golden Hall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[<a href="./images/339.png">339</a>]</span>
where she had held high revel on that summer night so long
ago, and whence she had fled before the Emperor's stern
decree. Remembrance was pain, and yet her thoughts
lingering in the past brought her echoes of joy and laughter.
What matter if the echo was softened by a sigh?</p>

<p>At length, in August, an attorney waited upon her in her
prison. He was charged to defend her in her trial, he said.
A semblance of justice was to be meted out to her; she should
benefit by the pleadings of a man of law. This personage was
a village notary, and all unfitted by knowledge or experience
to battle against the skilled prosecutors. And yet she was
grateful; for, at least, she would thus learn of what she was
accused. The list of her crimes was appalling. Firstly:
treason. Secondly: purloining of lands and monies. Thirdly:
witchcraft and black magic. Fourthly: bigamous intent.
Fifthly: attempted murder. It is characteristic of the age
that the fifth indictment should not have been the first.</p>

<p>Her treason consisted in having grasped the reins of
government from the hand of their rightful wielder, his
Highness Eberhard Ludwig of Wirtemberg; in having kept
back from his knowledge many facts in the administration of
the country, and destroying documents addressed to him.
Also in having been untrue to him in word and deed. Almost
comic this last&mdash;a sort of topsy-turvy adultery charge!</p>

<p>'Purloining of lands and monies.' She replied that if his
Highness's presents were accounted to her as peculation, she
had been guilty. For the rest she, having governed the
country in his name and with his sanction, had made free use
of the revenues for legitimate and public official purposes,
exactly as do other rulers, be they kings, dukes, or ministers
of state.</p>

<p>To the charge of witchcraft and black magic she refused to
make answer, save that she denied harming man, woman,
child, or beast. She was still hoist with her own petard: the
pitiful belief in the potency of her absurdities.</p>

<p>Bigamous intent she repudiated proudly. She had been
married in all legal form, and according to the ancient
privileges of ruling princes to take to wife whom they chose,
provided they, by open and public decree, declared any prior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[<a href="./images/340.png">340</a>]</span>
union null and void. It had pleased the Emperor as over-lord
to decide otherwise, and she had bowed to this decision, thus
forfeiting her just rights. For this she could not be punished,
she averred.</p>

<p>The attempted murder she denied absolutely. It was an
absurd story founded on the indiscretion of an insane servant,
whom she had dismissed from her service.</p>

<p>For the rest, she referred her accusers and her judges to the
first, and only competent witness on her side, viz. his Highness
Duke Eberhard Ludwig of Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>Such in few words are the contents of the massive dossier of
her trial, and her dignified answers.</p>

<p>The details these gentlemen of the law permitted themselves
to prepare are numerous, and unfit for publication to-day.
Her alleged misconduct (she being mistress, not wife&mdash;the
term seems strangely applied!) is accompanied with a
dozen disgusting stories, which it must be said were entirely
fabricated for the trial; and, as she herself pointed out, the
chief and only competent witness on her side was the man
she had loved and lived with for over twenty years,&mdash;who,
however, was the very person to permit the commencement of
this trial, and must have read and approved the accusations
in all their revolting details! He also, and he alone, could
prove that the woman had governed, purloined, etcetera, with
his sanction. He alone could say whether he had made free
gifts to his beloved mistress of lands, jewels, and monies; or
whether she had appropriated them without his consent.</p>

<p>Concerning the witchcraft charge it is difficult to exculpate
the Gr&auml;venitz, seeing she herself refused to deny her magic
practices, and there is little doubt that she possessed that
magnetic or hypnotic power, the use whereof our ancestors
called witchcraft. It is curious to speculate how much of this
power, in wonderfully subtle and varied forms, exists in every
human being of whom we say: 'They have great personal
charm.'</p>

<p>The village notary carried the Gr&auml;venitz's answers to Stuttgart,
and for many weeks the unhappy woman heard no more
of her trial. She waited in a fever of impatience, but she
dared not make any endeavour to obtain news for fear the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[<a href="./images/341.png">341</a>]</span>
governor should see fit once more to restrict her little
liberty.</p>

<p>Her pride was not broken; it was terribly sentient, quivering
with painful defeat and humiliation. Worse than all was the
silence she was forced to maintain. She spoke with Maria,
but the good, tender-hearted peasant, though she sympathised
passionately and with that noble loyalty of which such women
are capable, yet she could not comprehend or respond to the
workings of her mistress's brain, could not offer consolation
to the cultured mind.</p>

<p>In truth, it was a terrible downfall, a disaster; this gorgeous
life, this towering success, which of a sudden had been broken,
flung down into the very depths of mortal abasement.</p>

<p>The summer days passed. Autumn came, and still no news
arrived from Stuttgart, nor did the notary return to give her
information. Suspense deepened to melancholy, and, as the
days dragged by, melancholy was supplanted by despair. 'I
shall die in Hohen-Urach,' she said to Maria.</p>

<p>At length towards the beginning of November the notary
arrived.</p>

<p>'Your trial will take place soon, Excellency,' he said. 'It
has been retarded by his Highness's illness; that being over,
the matter will proceed.'</p>

<p>The man rubbed his hands in self-satisfaction. He was
persuaded that the authorities in Stuttgart had chosen him
for his qualities of mind and knowledge of law, and he had
become a very important personage in his own estimation and
in that of his cronies in the village.</p>

<p>'His Highness's illness, Herr M&auml;rkle? I pray you tell me
what has ailed the Duke?' Her voice shook a little, but the
man had spoken so airily that she could not believe the Duke's
illness had been serious.</p>

<p>'Ah, Excellency! you were unaware of the sad circumstances?
Yes, truly, a long and painful malady; lung trouble
it was.'</p>

<p>'It is over then? quite passed? I rejoice,' she returned.</p>

<p>'Yes, Excellency; it ended a week ago. His Highness died
in his sleep.'</p>

<p>She looked at him for a full moment as one deaf, who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[<a href="./images/342.png">342</a>]</span>
knowing some one has spoken some word, hears not and
wonders pitifully. The notary had turned away and busied
himself with writings and documents on the table. Already
his thoughts were rehearsing a wonderful oration he would
speak, a masterpiece of pleading. What a great man he was,
to be sure! Of course, he would move to Stuttgart. His
ambition soared&mdash;surely a very great lawyer.</p>

<p>A rustle of silken garments in the room behind him, and
two hands fell on his shoulders: hands of iron they seemed.</p>

<p>'Say that again; you do not know what you have said.' It
was a strange voice which spoke: a voice so hoarse, so toneless,
that the fat little man trembled, recalling in a flash the stories
of witches' transformation into ravening wolves or terrible
demons. He wriggled round. The Gr&auml;venitz stood over him,
her hands upon his shoulders, her eyes like two flames
scanning his face.</p>

<p>'Say what, Excellency? I do not know&mdash;&mdash;' The trivial
fact of the Duke's death and of this woman's agony had been
lost for him in his dream of his own judicial splendour.</p>

<p>'What did you say of his Highness? Tell me, or I will kill
you,' she returned in the same fearful voice.</p>

<p>'I said what all the world knows: that the Duke Eberhard
Ludwig died from lung trouble, on the 31st of October&mdash;a
week ago,'&mdash;he answered angrily, struggling to remove those
gripping hands from his shoulders.</p>

<p>'It is a lie! Another lie to torture me. Go, you lying,
cruel devil&mdash;the Duke shall punish you.'</p>

<p>She was mad for the moment; sense, dignity, all was swept
away in her terrified fury. She pushed the man from the
room, her murderous hands gripping and bruising his shoulders
with demoniacal force.</p>

<p>'Go, liar!' she cried, as she thrust the little man through
the door.</p>

<p>She stood silent and motionless. 'He said that all the world
knew,' she whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>She flung herself face downwards on the stone floor of the
prison-room, moaning and biting her hands like one possessed
of a devil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[<a href="./images/343.png">343</a>]</span></p><hr />

<p>Duke Karl Alexander, successor to Eberhard Ludwig, was
a gallant gentleman, hero of a hundred battles. He was
received in Wirtemberg with popular enthusiasm, in spite of
the damning fact that he was a Roman Catholic. He reassured
his people by swearing to uphold the Evangelical
Church. This being so, he began his reign with the entire
approbation of the Wirtembergers, and in the press of business
and rejoicings the trial of the Gr&auml;venitz seemed forgotten.
Still, the mass of carefully prepared accusations remained, and
the gentlemen of the law but bided their time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the chorus of approval in Stuttgart wavered;
for if Eberhard Ludwig had countenanced the Land-despoiler,
Karl Alexander was also ruled by a favourite, into whose
hands he confided the administration of the Dukedom. This
favourite was Joseph S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer, a Frankfort Jew.
To the horror of officialdom, S&uuml;ss was made Minister of
Finance, and, in point of fact, chief adviser to the new
Duke.</p>

<p>Unheard of that a Jew should be admitted into the government!
That one of the despised race should appear at court;
not only appear, but rule, direct all things, be the familiar
friend of a noble Duke!</p>

<p>If money had been levied by the Gr&auml;venitz, far heavier
taxes were imposed by S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer. If the court at
Ludwigsburg had been brilliant and lavish in the Land-despoiler's
day, it was the scene of an unending series of
costly festivities under the new r&eacute;gime. And if the late
Duke's mistress had been ruinous to the country's finance,
the new Duke maintained half a dozen such ladies in the
greatest splendour. S&uuml;ss was accused of arranging the Duke's
relations with these ladies, and of sharing their favours with
his unsuspecting patron. It is certain that the Jew led a
dissolute life, and that his amours were numerous.</p>

<p>The Wirtembergers were in despair, and murmured more
ominously than ever; but they were powerless. S&uuml;ss was
master of the situation, exactly as the Gr&auml;venitz had been
before.</p>

<p>Of all this the prisoner at Hohen-Urach knew nothing.
She succeeded in persuading the governor to forward a letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[<a href="./images/344.png">344</a>]</span>
from her to her brother, Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz, in which she
implored him to visit her; but she received no answer from
that estimable personage. In point of fact, he was in an
awkward predicament himself. True, he had sided against
his sister openly, but the Duke, not relishing a too glaring
reminder of the past, had commanded him to retire to
Welzheim. At Eberhard Ludwig's death Gr&auml;venitz waited
upon Karl Alexander, who, honest gentleman, disapproved
of a brother showing open hostility and ingratitude to a
sister, and begged the petitioner to return to his country-seat.</p>

<p>Now Gr&auml;venitz, to his horror, found that he was implicated
in his sister's misdemeanours. Had he not shared in the
benefits of her peculations? In vain he protested, denouncing
his sister and benefactress in pompous self-righteous
words and writings. But the legal authorities paid no heed,
and intimated briefly that Welzheim did not belong to him,
although he held it in his possession; nine points of the law
certainly, but not conferring ownership. He was directed to
relinquish Welzheim to the new Duke's representatives.
This he declined with many high-flown expressions, which,
however, the legal gentlemen considered beside the point at
issue; and Count Friedrich Gr&auml;venitz was lodged in his own
palace in Stuttgart, under arrest and well guarded. He was
tried for peculation, but the prosecution ceased when Friedrich
Gr&auml;venitz consented to deliver up Welzheim to his Highness
the Duke, and to pay a fine of fifty-six thousand gulden.
He was liberated and permitted to leave the country, which
he did, repairing to Vienna where he appealed to the imperial
tribunal for justice.</p>

<p>When he received his sister's letter he was under arrest,
and later his own affairs absorbed him. So the Gr&auml;venitz's
appeal remained unanswered. The appointed day came for
her trial, and the village notary spoke his dreamed-of oration.
The tribunal listened, or appeared to listen, but the sentence
was a foregone conclusion. Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz,
Countess of W&uuml;rben, late Landhofmeisterin of Wirtemberg,
was condemned to death.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[<a href="./images/345.png">345</a>]</span>
Yet it was written in her book of Destiny, that Vienna
should interfere in all the important events of her life. The
Emperor intimated that, as Countess of the Empire, she could
not be put to death without his consent, and this he withheld.
S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, Wirtemberg's Minister of Finance, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[<a href="./images/346.png">346</a>]</span>
appealed on her behalf. The sentence was commuted to
perpetual imprisonment and forfeiture of all lands, monies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>[<a href="./images/347.png">347</a>]</span>
and jewels. This information was imparted to her by the
prison governor. She received it calmly, merely remarking:
'Death would have been much shorter.' She had sunk into
an apathy since the news of his Highness's decease.</p>

<p>The winter passed without event. Spring found the
Gr&auml;venitz grown white-haired, and she had fallen into the
habit of patient, indifferent acquiescence in all things. Maria
wished her to walk upon the ramparts for an hour's fresh air?
Very well, she would go.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency must eat, must sleep, must rest.'</p>

<p>'Certainly; it does not matter. I will do as you say,
Maria.'</p>

<p>It was as though she gave her body into the peasant
woman's command; her soul was elsewhere, in that mysterious
land into which her eyes seemed to be for ever gazing with
painful, straining effort, seeking&mdash;seeking and imploring.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May, an official document was brought
to the governor of Hohen-Urach. It contained the pardon of
Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz, provided she undertook to leave
Wirtemberg for ever, and to abandon any future claims upon
land or property of all sorts in the Dukedom. The governor
was directed to accompany the lady to the frontier, with an
escort of two hundred horse. Further, he was to place in
her hand, at the moment of her passing out of Wirtemberg
territory, a sum of a hundred thousand gulden, 'in fair
compensation for any loss incurred,' it was set forth in the
pardon. With this surprising document was a sealed letter
addressed to the Gr&auml;venitz, which was to be delivered
immediately.</p>

<p>The governor repaired to the prisoner's apartment, but found
it deserted. The Gr&auml;venitz was taking the air upon the
ramparts. He found her leaning over the stone parapet,
gazing, as usual, into the distance with those terrible, haunted,
unseeing eyes. In vain the valley was radiant with Spring's
tender treasury; she gazed unseeing at the wealth of blossom,
the feathery green of the beech-trees, and at the rounded hills
so rich in sombre firs enhancing the wondrous youth of the
beech leaves; at the little hill-town, red-roofed and sheltered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[<a href="./images/348.png">348</a>]</span>
clustering round the old castle. All this peaceful beauty of
Nature's renascence was nothing to her. As she had said,
death would have been much shorter; this long-drawn agony,
this numb pain, was death in life.</p>

<p>'I have the happiness to announce to your Excellency that
his Highness the Duke has granted you pardon. When it
suits you to travel, I am to accompany you to the frontier
under escort,' the governor said coldly.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes upon him, but she gave no sign of
comprehension; once only she started and winced, when he
said his Highness the Duke, otherwise she remained unmoved
and unresponding as one deaf. He waited a moment for her
to speak, then slowly repeated his announcement.</p>

<p>'Where am I to go to?' she said at last in a low, uncertain
voice.</p>

<p>'Where it pleases your Excellency. Anywhere out of
Wirtemberg.'</p>

<p>She turned to Maria who stood behind her. 'Have I a house
anywhere? I have forgotten,' she said.</p>

<p>'Surely, surely, Excellency; your castle at Schaffhausen,<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing single quote">'</ins>
replied the peasant woman.</p>

<p>'Very well; we will start to-morrow for Schaffhausen,' the
Gr&auml;venitz answered in her new, broken, docile voice.</p>

<p>'There is a letter for you, Madame,' the governor told her.</p>

<p>'A letter? Who should write to me? The dead do not
write.'</p>

<p>'O Madame! Madame! read it; there may be good news,'
cried Maria.</p>

<p>'Good news? Good news for me? There can be none. Do
you not know that there can be none?' she said tonelessly.</p>

<p>Even the governor's eyes were wet as he handed her the
letter. She broke the seal listlessly.</p>

<p>'I send you the best terms I can make for you, in remembrance
of the Judengasse of Stuttgart, and in gratitude
for your kindness to my race.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joseph S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer.</span>'</p>

<hr />

<p>Fastened in one corner of this short missive glittered a
little jewel. The Gr&auml;venitz looked long at it, not comprehending.
Then a scene of her past came back to her&mdash;she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[<a href="./images/349.png">349</a>]</span>
in a darkened room, which smelt of strange, sweet essences,
and a Jewish boy sang a Hebrew love-song.</p>

<p>Joseph S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer, the Jew, had proved himself,
in this instance, to be truly what Eberhard Ludwig had called
him in pleasantry many years ago&mdash;'un preux chevalier.'
One who could render homage and service to a fallen
favourite.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Joseph S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer was the son of Michaele, a famous Jewish
beauty, daughter of Rabbi Salomon of Frankfort, a musician of talent.
Michaele was not only possessed of wonderful beauty, but God had blessed
her with a glorious voice. She married Rabbi Isaschar S&uuml;sskind Oppenheimer,
also a singer and musician, and together the couple wandered from
city to city, and from palace to castle, discoursing sweet melodies. The
lady's morals suffered from this vagrant life, and the Jewish community of
Frankfort stood aghast at her amours. Jewish women are usually remarkably
virtuous, and Michaele's evil reputation was easily achieved.
</p><p>
There was an ugly story concerning the birth of Joseph S&uuml;ss. In brief,
he was reported to be a love-child; but the dates do not tally, and it is
certain that Rabbi Isaschar accepted the infant as his own. From his
mother Joseph S&uuml;ss inherited marvellous personal beauty, and from both his
parents his musical gift. From the mother too, if we are to believe all the
tales, he received a nature of abnormal, passionate sensuality.
</p><p>
At an early age S&uuml;ss was sent to his relatives in Vienna, the famous bankers
Oppenheimer. Here the boy was reared in splendour and refinement,
and instructed in the intricacies of banking, usury&mdash;in short, in finance.
He repaired occasionally to his family in Frankfort, halting on the road to
visit an aged relation in Stuttgart, Frau Widow Hazzim, at whose house in
the Judengasse he made the acquaintance of Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz.
</p><p>
S&uuml;ss matured early, and became, not a musician as he had boasted in his
childhood, but a very capable financier. He fell in with Duke Karl Alexander
of Wirtemberg during a sojourn at Wildbad. His Highness sought
a secretary and treasurer, and he was immediately captivated by the young
Jew's personal beauty, his fascination, his vivid intelligence, and knowledge
of business. The Duchess was interested, attracted, and delighted in S&uuml;ss's
music and the haunting charm of those ancient Hebrew melodies which his
father, Rabbi Isaschar, had taught him. S&uuml;ss was taken into his Highness's
service, and when Karl Alexander succeeded his cousin Eberhard
Ludwig in the Dukedom of Wirtemberg, the Jew accompanied his patron to
Ludwigsburg and Stuttgart. He was made Minister of Finance and became,
in reality, ruler of the court, for the Duke gave over everything to his trusted
favourite. The treasury was exhausted by the Gr&auml;venitz's magnificence,
and S&uuml;ss set to work to replenish the empty chests.
</p><p>
It would be too long to recount here the endless money-raising schemes
which were put in motion by S&uuml;ss; suffice it to say, that never had
Wirtemberg been so squeezed even in the time of Eberhard Ludwig. But
if S&uuml;ss procured vast sums, he spent them as readily. The festivities at
Ludwigsburg were more opulently splendid and more numerous than ever,
and the Duke had six mistresses and a favourite to enrich instead of one
Land-despoiler! S&uuml;ss lived like a prince&mdash;and a very lavish prince at that&mdash;and
the money, of course, came from the Duke's treasury. Now Michaele's
heritage became noticeable; if the Duke had six mistresses S&uuml;ss had sixty.
No woman could resist him; they said he was so gloriously handsome, so
witty, so 'differing from the rest of mankind,'&mdash;not an original statement
from amorous dames!
</p><p>
Thus S&uuml;ss inherited his mother's nature, and together with his unbridled
passion for love came the illimited desire for, and need of, gold.
</p><p>
By the first, he incurred the hatred of those men&mdash;husbands, brothers,
fathers of the women he took for his pleasure; by the second, the undying
animosity of the oppressed taxpayers. The end came swiftly. Four years
of debauch and lavish expenditure, and death fell suddenly upon Karl
Alexander of Wirtemberg. He died at nine of the clock one evening, and
the next dawn saw Joseph S&uuml;ss a hunted fugitive. He was caught between
Ludwigsburg and Stuttgart, and immediately thrown into prison. Here he
languished, a prey to terrible anxiety and remorse; his only visitants were
pastors of the Christian religion who tortured him with argument. 'You
are a Jew, but you do not even adhere to the damnable tenets of your vile
cult,' they said.
</p><p>
'I am a man and no coward, and I will not abjure the faith of my
fathers,' he responded. They held out spurious hopes of pardon would
he swear to the pure faith of the Crucified, but S&uuml;ss remained nobly
obdurate. Then the Church&mdash;she to whom Christ bequeathed His sweet
message of pardon, of tenderness, and of leniency&mdash;deserted the faithful
Jew, and the law of human cruelty and punishment took hold of him. He
was accorded no trial. His sins were as scarlet indeed; besides, he of
the despised race had dared to rule. The name Jew was a stigma in itself,
and this word the people howled round the tumbril which bore the erstwhile
gorgeous favourite to a death of ignominy. A few women in the
crowd sighed and shed a tear when they saw the godlike beauty of the
man, broken to pathetic ruin by adversity, white-haired, vilified, aged by
his degradation; but chiefly the crowd howled and reviled, and the men
spat in the Jew's face and covered him with a load of horse-dung and foul
ordure. They hung him finally after unspeakable tortures. Then his body
was left to rot in Stuttgart's market-place in the sight of all. A hideous
carrion dangling in a silver cage, which his judges had caused to be constructed
as a terrible warning to those who would profit by the favour
of princes.
</p><p>
Tragic enough in itself, this story of the downfall of a superb ruler
and courtier, the more appalling, when we consider that it was chiefly a
cruel triumph of race hatred. No unbaptized Jew in German history has
risen to such official eminence as Joseph S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer, and there is
little doubt that, had he not been of the race of Israel, even though he had
committed the same crimes, he would not have suffered this fearsome
death.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>REST</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Memories that make the heart a tomb.'</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is solace to the mourner in the sound of rushing waters;
most of all can the stricken soul find a short oblivion in the
ceaseless chant of the ocean's mighty surging; and by the
tumult of a great river human unrest is soothed ineffably.</p>

<p>At Schaffhausen the Rhine falls in giant cascades, roaring
and dashing against those rocks which, legend says, Wotan
flung into the river in his mighty rage against a poor husbandman
who had drowned himself and his lowly wife because her
mortal beauty had excited the desire of the amorous wanderer.</p>

<p>White, whirling foam, and above a thin, glistening, veil-like
mist made of the myriad drops flung up from the water's
impact; but here too the eternal poet, Legend, has wrought
a delicate phantasy: this mist he calls the breath from the lips
of the Rhine-maidens who sing for ever beneath the foam.</p>

<p>An enchanted place this Schaffhausen, guarded by the great
white Alps whose pure crests rise in awful majesty to high
Heaven. And here it was that the Gr&auml;venitz dwelt after she left
Wirtemberg, and here Time the consoler healed her bruised
heart and her crushed pride. She dwelt in the small castle
which Zollern had given her and where her marriage with
W&uuml;rben had been solemnised. Her soul rested from pain,
but there were torturing ghosts of the past around her:
Eberhard Ludwig, Madame de Ruth, Zollern, her unkind
brother, even the fraudulent attorney Sch&uuml;tz, and the ridiculous
figure of her name-husband, Nepomuk W&uuml;rben. Yes, all her
life's denizens had vanished. Death or absence had swallowed
them; only she, the central figure, remained.</p>

<p>She was memory-haunted, who herself was but a memory.</p>

<p>Her great healthfulness endured, but sometimes she suffered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>[<a href="./images/351.png">351</a>]</span>
from strange swoons. 'It is from the heart,' said the
apothecary whom Maria called in.</p>

<p>'God knows&mdash;heart affliction!' said the Gr&auml;venitz bitterly,
when they told her of this verdict.</p>

<p>Years passed, and still she lingered at Schaffhausen, though
she often promised herself to journey to Berlin armed with
that 'Letter of Royal Protection' which Zollern had procured
for her from Prussia's first King Friedrich <span class="smcap">i.</span> But she shrank
from bringing her cause before Friedrich Wilhelm <span class="smcap">i.</span>, the
blustering monarch who had played so unexpected a r&ocirc;le in
her life. She accounted him as the destroyer of her happiness,
for she believed that it was he alone who had influenced
Eberhard Ludwig against her, and had induced him to banish
her. Woman-like, she threw the blame of her lover's action
entirely upon the adviser.</p>

<p>She hankered after her beautiful Freudenthal, and she
dreamed of returning thither. Deeming herself forgotten, she
believed she would be safe in Wirtemberg. Also the fierce
torrent of the people's rage had been diverted to another
channel, their hatred sated with their vengeance on another
favourite. S&uuml;ss Oppenheimer, who had saved her from imprisonment,
had paid the penalty of his own crimes; in his
expiation he had borne the brunt, and, for the time, appeased
the people's wrath against favouritism.</p>

<p>Karl Alexander of Wirtemberg was dead, and his son, a child
of some twelve years, was Duke of Wirtemberg. He resided
in Stuttgart with his mother, a princess of the House of Thurn
and Taxis.</p>

<p>Ludwigsburg was deserted, the palace closed; the busy crowd
of merchants, clothiers, perruquiers, dressmakers, which had
flocked to the new centre of gaiety, had vanished. The
Gr&auml;venitz had heard that Ludwigsburg was like a city of the
dead, with grass-grown streets and deserted houses. Surely she,
who belonged to that forgotten past, was forgotten also? She
longed to return and once more to view the scenes of her dead
glory. But the years passed, and she lingered in Switzerland.</p>

<p>In 1740 she heard of the death of Friedrich Wilhelm <span class="smcap">i.</span> of
Prussia, and of the accession of his much-tried son&mdash;that
Friedrich whom the world was justly to call Great.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>[<a href="./images/352.png">352</a>]</span>
A fresh hope sprang up in the Gr&auml;venitz's heart. This young
man, so noble, so just, so cultured, would he not give her
justice? She would journey to Berlin and present the Letter
of Royal Protection; he would recognise her claims, and induce
the Wirtemberg government to give her back her Freudenthal.</p>

<p>The headman of the canton of Schaffhausen supplied her
with the necessary travelling papers. 'A lady of quality and
her serving-maid journeying to Berlin on court business,' it
was certified therein; no mention of the names of Gr&auml;venitz or
W&uuml;rben, which might have awakened dangerous memories.</p>

<p>Once more her way lay through the spring-radiant land.
Fate had caused her to wait for the blossom, it was her destiny
always to see Wirtemberg clothed in the fairest raiment. She
journeyed through the smiling valleys, she passed beside the
peaceful Neckar river. Her way led her near to Rottenburg,
and she turned from her road to visit the Neuhaus. Here
she found ruin. Madame de Ruth had bequeathed her property
to Zollern, and while he lived the place had been tended with
pious care; but he too was dead, and the Neuhaus had passed
to an heir-at-law who knew not, and if he had known, would
not have comprehended, the loving memory which caused the
dilapidated mansion to be treasured. It is always so; there is
no sadder thing than the melancholy of a place, once sacred
and beloved, which has fallen into the chill hands of the
indifference of another generation.</p>

<p>The Neuhaus was turned farm: the upper rooms were used
as hay-lofts, and in that long, panelled living-room, which
had seen Wilhelmine von Gr&auml;venitz's strange marriage, a
peasant woman cooked, scolding her brood of children. She
stared at the Gr&auml;venitz.</p>

<p>'Oh yes! this is my husband's farm. What do you want
with me? See the house? There is not much to see,' she said
suspiciously. A gulden changed her tone.</p>

<p>'Certainly; look if you like,' she said, and followed the sad
visitant from room to room, hands on hips, and shrill voice
explaining how the rats were so bad in the house that she
and her husband would have to leave next month.</p>

<p>'Is there a grave here? a grave surrounded by a stone
wall? No? But it was consecrated ground, it cannot have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>[<a href="./images/353.png">353</a>]</span>
been destroyed?' The Gr&auml;venitz spoke quietly, but she could
have wept aloud.</p>

<p>Yes, the woman said, there was a bit of walled-off land,
but it did not belong to them. There was a gate, and they had
not the key. Perhaps there was a grave there; the grass grew
so high you could not tell. She led her visitor through the
neglected garden which Spring, the glorious gardener, had
yet made fair with blossom and the budding lilac. The
Gr&auml;venitz peered through the bars of the graveyard gate.
Ah, thank God! who sends Spring to garnish the graves of
the forgotten dead! The tombs were hidden by a fair coronal
of waving grasses, and the redthorns above made a baldaquin
more beautiful than the work of man's hand.</p>

<p>'Forgotten, yet so peaceful,' she murmured as she turned
away.</p>

<p>'Did you speak, lady?' said the peasant woman; but the
Gr&auml;venitz shook her head.</p>

<p>'Only to myself; only to myself always now,' she answered.</p>

<p>At T&uuml;bingen no one paid heed to the traveller, but she did
not venture up to the castle. She might have dared it, for
none would have remembered her, or recognised in the tall,
white-haired woman the beautiful young courtesan who had
held mock court in the ancient university castle. She learned
that no Duke had resided there for many years, it was entirely
given up to the students and their grave professors.</p>

<p>'But the state-rooms? I heard that there were fine apartments
in the castle, where princes and their courts held high
revel?' she queried of the innkeeper.</p>

<p>'Eh! all those are dismantled now, Madame,' returned the
man. Dismantled&mdash;the word rang in her ears. Yes; the
very scenes of her glorious past were changed.</p>

<p>Through the shadowy T&uuml;bingen forest she journeyed onwards.
She commanded her driver to turn aside before Stuttgart,
and thus she passed along by-roads to Ludwigsburg.</p>

<p>The sun was still high in the heavens when she entered the
well-remembered avenue of shady chestnut-trees. Here too
Spring had been busy, crowning the trees with bloom. A
regal decoration for her home-coming, she thought.</p>

<p>At the stately town-gate her coach halted, and for the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>[<a href="./images/354.png">354</a>]</span>
time in her life she paid toll upon entering Ludwigsburg.
Her eyes sought the monogram sculptured on the stone gate-pillars:
'E. L.' entwined in graceful curves on a rounded
shield upheld by playful amorini. How well she remembered
when Frisoni had brought her the drawings for this device.
Would her Excellency wish her chiffre to appear in the
design? the Italian had asked, and she had rejected the
proposal, she hardly knew why.</p>

<p>Her coach lumbered down the Ludwigsburg street. It was
in a deplorable condition, and the heavy carriage jolted and
swung from side to side. The houses which bordered one
side of the street were closed and shuttered, and their blank
windows seemed like sightless yet imploring eyes gazing
towards the deserted palace gardens.</p>

<p>The driver halted. She heard him shouting to one of the
rare passers-by in this dead city, 'Where is the inn?' She
made a movement forward and would have called through
the window, 'The inn is further down the street,' but she
checked herself, remembering that she must betray no knowledge
of the town she had created.</p>

<p>It was a daring thing, this visit to Wirtemberg. Who
could tell if some one might not recognise her and set a howling
mob upon her? The law would not interfere with her;
she had been pardoned, and was merely passing through the
country on her journey to Berlin, but some remnant of hatred
might linger in the peasants' memory.</p>

<p>When she reached the inn the innkeeper looked hard at his
guest. Did he recognise her? she wondered.</p>

<p>'Is this Ludwigsburg?' she asked, feigning ignorance.</p>

<p>'Yes, lady. Whom have I the honour of serving?'</p>

<p>She gave some name at random, adding: 'I am travelling
from Austria and Switzerland home to Berlin.' Then she
inquired concerning the palace. Could a stranger visit the
gardens? Did the reigning prince reside in that beautiful
palace? and so on, questioning like an inquisitive traveller.</p>

<p>If she wished she could see the whole place, she was told.
The new gatekeeper was a very friendly fellow; he would let
her into the gardens if she gave him a trifle to purchase a
drink of wine. She ordered a meal and pretended to eat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>[<a href="./images/355.png">355</a>]</span>
though the food choked her, but she dared not show undue
eagerness to visit the palace. At length the dreary subterfuges
were over; she had intimated her intention of passing
the night at the inn; she had been shown the guest-chamber;
she had pretended to rest, and now she was free to repair to
her sorry sight-seeing without incurring suspicion.</p>

<p>Evening fell over Ludwigsburg, yet the rounded roofs of the
palace were still kissed by the departing sunshine, when she
walked up to the gateway through which she had so often
driven in ceremonious state surrounded by the splendid Silver
Guard. A squat-figured, broad-faced Wirtemberger stood in
the gateway, smoking a huge carved wood pipe of rank
tobacco. The blue smoke rose in spirals from the pipe bowl,
and the man blew clouds of a browner hue, the delicate blue-grey
of the smoke spoiled from the admixture of human breath.</p>

<p>The man watched the Gr&auml;venitz's approach without offering
greeting or comment.</p>

<p>'Are you the gatekeeper?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, that I am,' he grunted ungraciously. Good Heavens!
how she would have had him flogged if he had spoken to her
thus twelve years ago! She looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>'I am a stranger, and would fain visit this famous palace,'
she said.</p>

<p>'Have you an order from the court? I cannot let strangers
enter without one,' he returned gruffly.</p>

<p>'No, I have no order. Will you let me see the gardens, at
least?' He shook his head and continued smoking.</p>

<p>'See, I will give you something for your trouble, but I must
see the gardens.' She held out two golden pieces. 'Take
these, and let me enter,' she said imploringly.</p>

<p>The man's manner changed. This must be some great lady
if she could pay him in gold when he would have let her in for
a few groschen. Well, these travellers often had strange fancies;
and if it pleased her to pay so much for so small a thing!&mdash;He
took the money and moved aside.</p>

<p>'Go in, go in, lady! Shall I come round with you? I have
heard tell all about the old days here: I can show you where
Duke Eberhard Ludwig lived, and where the Duke Karl died.
I will go fetch the castle keys.' She shuddered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>[<a href="./images/356.png">356</a>]</span>
'No! no! I do not wish to see; I will only walk in the
garden. Do not disturb yourself,' she said hastily, and passed
on. The gatekeeper followed her a few steps: 'You can see
the gardens of La Favorite, if you wish; you need only walk
straight from the north terraces and you will come to La
Favorite,' he called after her. How strange it was to be thus
directed by a newcomer, told the way, shown what she had
planned and devised yard by yard. She nodded to the man.
'I thank you, I shall find my way,' she answered.</p>

<p>And now she was free to wander in the past, free to suffer
the exquisite pain of memory. She walked slowly on. How
the trees had grown! And the little lilacs she had planted&mdash;they
were tall bushes now. The paths were grass-grown,
the water in the basin of the fountain on the south side was
covered with weeds and thick green slime, the large stone
vases which stood round the basin were moss-covered. The
lichen hid the medallions on the vases, the medallions
which bore her sculptured portrait. There were the clumps
of rose peonies she had planted&mdash;in bud too&mdash;she would never
see them flower again. On, through the gardens to the
courtyard where grass grew between the paving-stones. The
palace windows were closed and shuttered. No sound broke
the stillness of this deserted dwelling-place. The thought
came to her that only herself, a ghost of past glories, and
perhaps the sinister spectre of the White Lady, moved about
the dead palace. She passed on. The door of the main
entrance on the ground floor of the Corps de Logis stood ajar.
Strange that it should be so in this shut house. She entered;
no, it could not matter even if the doors had stood wide open,
for the hall was entirely empty&mdash;not a chair or table for a thief
to drag away! And the well-remembered staircase, leading
to Eberhard Ludwig's apartments, was boarded up with rough
deal planks.</p>

<p>The air struck chill and tomblike in the entrance-hall, yet
the Gr&auml;venitz lingered. Yes; there from the ceiling her own
face looked down at her in two bas-reliefs. In one the face
was smiling with half-open, voluptuous lips, and the eyes, a
little drooping, told of some delicious thrill of passion.
Opposite this was the figure of Time, winged and frowning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>[<a href="./images/357.png">357</a>]</span>
with huge scythe-blades in his mighty hands. She shuddered;
those relentless blades had indeed mown down the little day
of her love's triumph. What devil had prompted the Italian
Frisoni to illustrate this terrible truth upon the very palace
built to honour her?</p>

<p>Across the entrance-hall she saw another bas-relief, again
her face, but serious this time, looking fixedly, gravely upwards&mdash;the
expression of one who aspires, of one who would
compel Destiny. Facing this was a medallion bearing a ducal
crown in the centre, the scroll-work round this medallion was
made of giant thorns, and a peering, mocking satyr's face
peeped out from the thorn wreath.</p>

<p>Had the Italian dared to mock her thus? And in the old
days she had not noted the insolent meaning underlying the
beautiful designs! How she would have revenged herself upon
the artist!</p>

<p>She turned away. After all, the man had spoken truly in
his sculptured allegory: Time, and Change, and Death are
more mighty than Love, than Joy, than Power. She mused
on, and unconsciously her wanderings, led by old custom's
memory, brought her to the vaulted arcade beside the door of
the east pavilion where she had dwelt. Here, too, her own
face met her in the bas-reliefs. Graceful designs of musical
instruments, emblems of her taste, and everywhere laughing
Cupids held wreathed flowers, viole d'amore, harps and lutes
around the mistress-musician's voluptuous face.</p>

<p>The carven stone held for ever the memory of Eberhard
Ludwig's homage in the beauteous picturing of Love, Laughter,
Music&mdash;all that she had wielded with such potency to charm;
and she knew that the sneering artist-architect had hidden
everywhere the figure of Time the Avenger; sometimes she
had called him the Consoler, but she knew him better now as
the Eternally Pitiless, waiting to reap his harvest&mdash;the flowers
reaped with the wheat.</p>

<p>Suddenly the full message came to her: 'All things wither,
but the remembrance of the sinful light of love is bitter pain,
whereas the memory of the pure woman is sweet with children's
tears.' She had read the words in some book, they smote her
now. In an agony of weeping she leaned her head against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>[<a href="./images/358.png">358</a>]</span>
the stone picture of Music, Love, and Laughter, and her own
young face. 'O God! O God! have I not atoned by pain?'
she moaned.</p>

<p>A soft evening breeze came stealing round her. Nature
could give no answer to her fearful questioning, but the gentle
Spring wind kissed her on lips and brow. She rose and took
her way to the terrace. Here, too, was ruinous neglect&mdash;grass-grown
paths, moss-covered sculptures, untended plants. She
looked up at the windows of the rooms which had been
Eberhard Ludwig's; they were closed and shuttered.&mdash;Dead,
everything was dead!</p>

<p>She hurried on towards La Favorite, her Ch&acirc;teau Joyeux.
Here again was ruin, and here also her own face met her
sculptured everywhere&mdash;smiling, young, and indifferent to the
ruin. The flowering parterre was untended, but the lilacs and
the redthorn-trees made the garden fair. The long Spring
twilight faded, night drew near&mdash;and the Gr&auml;venitz turned
away. 'Farewell,' she said aloud, 'the night comes! Farewell,
Spring!'</p>

<hr />

<p>That night Maria could not induce her beloved mistress to
taste food. 'I am so weary, Maria, let me rest. I think God
will give me sleep,' she said, and the faithful peasant woman
left her.</p>

<p>In the morning Maria found her resting still. God had
given her the Great Sleep.</p>
